friendly_name: Pos Of Trailing Set Bit
description: |-
  Identical to bits28_days_since_seen.  Returns a 0-based index of the rightmost set bit in the passed bit pattern or null if no bits are set (bits = 0).  To determine this position, we take a bitwise AND of the bit pattern and its complement, then we determine the position of the bit via base-2 logarithm; see https://stackoverflow.com/a/42747608/1260237
