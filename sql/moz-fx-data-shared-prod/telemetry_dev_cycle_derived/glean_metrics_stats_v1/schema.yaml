- name: glean_app
  type: STRING

  description: Name of glean app

- name: metric
  type: STRING
  mode: NULLABLE
  description: Name of glean metric

- name: type
  type: STRING

  description: Type of glean metric

- name: release_date
  type: DATE
  mode: NULLABLE
  description: First day the metric was seen in the data

- name: last_date
  type: DATE
  mode: NULLABLE
  description: >
    Last date the metric was sent. Can be after the time the metric was
    recorded for expired metrics that are still in the code base.

- name: expires
  type: STRING
  mode: NULLABLE
  description: Expires. Can be "never", a date or a version number

- name: expired_date
  type: DATE
  mode: NULLABLE
  description: >
    Date the metric is no longer collected. This is calculated with both the
    last_date ad the expires column. After the expiration date even if data
    is still sent, it is not stored, so later days will be ignored in the data
    collection. If the expiration is set for later but we don't get any new
    data this indicates that the metric is removed from the code and therefor
    also expired.
