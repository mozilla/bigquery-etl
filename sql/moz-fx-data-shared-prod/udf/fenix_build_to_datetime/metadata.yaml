friendly_name: Fenix Build To Datetime
description: |
  Convert the Fenix client_info.app_build-format string to a DATETIME.
  May return NULL on failure.

  Fenix originally used an [8-digit app_build format](
    https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/blob/c7283447/automation/gradle/versionCode.gradle#L12-L16)

  In short it is `yDDDHHmm`:

   * y is years since 2018
   * DDD is day of year, 0-padded, 001-366
   * HH is hour of day, 00-23
   * mm is minute of hour, 00-59

  The last date seen with an 8-digit build ID is 2020-08-10.

  Newer builds use a [10-digit format](
    https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/blob/e6ee13dc/buildSrc/src/main/java/Config.kt#L55-L112)
  where the integer represents a pattern consisting of 32 bits.
  The 17 bits starting 13 bits from the left represent a number of hours since
  UTC midnight beginning 2014-12-28.

  This function tolerates both formats.

  After using this you may wish to `DATETIME_TRUNC(result, DAY)` for grouping
  by build date.
