friendly_name: Coalesce Adjacent Days 365 Bits
description: |-
  Coalesce previous data's PCD with the new data's PCD. We generally want to believe only the first reasonable profile creation date that we receive from a client. Given bytes representing usage from the previous day and the current day, this function shifts the first argument by one day and returns either that value if non-zero and non-null, the current day value if non-zero and non-null, or else 0.
