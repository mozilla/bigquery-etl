friendly_name: Stripe subscriptions
description: |-
  Stripe subscriptions as recorded by Fivetran, with revisions to improve historical accuracy.

  This table's schema closely mirrors Stripe's subscriptions API (https://stripe.com/docs/api/subscriptions/object).
  Fields which Fivetran doesn't sync and fields we've specifically chosen not to include (e.g. PII) have been omitted.
  In particular, all address fields except country have been omitted because Firefox Account user IDs are present and this is in a Mozilla-confidential dataset.
