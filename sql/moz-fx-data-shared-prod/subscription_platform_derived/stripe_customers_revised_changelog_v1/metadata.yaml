friendly_name: Stripe customers revised changelog
description: |-
  Changes to Stripe customers as recorded by Fivetran, with revisions to improve historical accuracy.

  The underlying changelog is only truly accurate from the most recent full rebuild from scratch (2023-07-10) going forward.
  As a result, we've had to adjust and synthesize records to more accurately reconstruct history.

  This table's schema closely mirrors Stripe's customers API (https://stripe.com/docs/api/customers/object).
  Fields which Fivetran doesn't sync and fields we've specifically chosen not to include (e.g. PII) have been omitted.
  In particular, all address fields except country have been omitted because Firefox Account user IDs are present and this is in a Mozilla-confidential dataset.
