friendly_name: Top Domains
description: |-
  A combination of the CrUX (chrome ux report) origins and Tranco top domains.
  CrUX has domains broken down by country and Tranco has ranking information.
  Neither dataset has a perfectly joinable key so we do a "good enough for
  government work" effort in joining the two.
