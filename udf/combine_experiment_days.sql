/*

The "clients_last_seen" class of tables represent various types of client
activity within a 28-day window as bit patterns.

This function takes in two arrays of structs where each entry gives the
bit pattern for days in which we saw a ping for a given user in a given
experiment. We combine the bit patterns for the previous day and the
current day, returning a single array of experiment structs.
