friendly_name: Mobile Usage 2021
description: |-
  Stable source for 2021 KPI data on mobile usage, including
  cumulative days of use (`cdou`) broken out by dimensions.

  Queries should generally be `SUM` of the `cdou`, `dau`,
  `wau`, or `mau` fields, grouped by any dimensions you want to compare
  or filtered to only your target population.

  Example query to see CDOU over time for Firefox for iOS:
  ```
  SELECT
    submission_date,
    SUM(cdou) AS cdou
  FROM mozdata.telemetry.mobile_usage_2021
  WHERE app_name = 'firefox_ios'
  GROUP BY submission_date
  ORDER BY submission_date
  ```
