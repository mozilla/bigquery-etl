friendly_name: MDN Glean Events
description: |-
  This view unions `mdn_fred.events_stream`, and `mdn_yari.events_stream`.

  Yari data covers MDN page loads between 2024-04-23 and Fred's launch on
  2025-08-19, but it also reflects MDN Plus page loads after that date.

  Fred data covers MDN page loads and element clicks from 2025-08-19.

  Important: Yari data only contains page loads, not Yari actions, whereas
  Fred data contains both page loads as well as element clicks.

  The goal of this view is to ease authoring of page load queries against
  `mdn_fred.events_stream`, that should also cover the time before Fred.

  For queries that do not require data before 2025-08-19 or MDN Plus data,
  prefer using `mdn_fred.events_stream` directly.

  For queries that should cover data going back as far as 2024-04-23,
  consider using `mdn.legacy_page_v1` instead.
