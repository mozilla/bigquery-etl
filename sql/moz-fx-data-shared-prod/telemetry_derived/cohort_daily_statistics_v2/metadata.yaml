friendly_name: Cohort Daily Statistics v2
description: |-
  Cohort Daily Statistics consists of one row per cohort date
  per activity date (up to 180 days after the cohort start date)
  It's a summary of the cohort's activity in that day.

  Note that the values for client attributes are based on the
  attributes at the time the cohort started (rather than the
  values at activity time)

  Note that data is pulled from clients_last_seen_v1 and more
  importantly clients_first_seen_v2
