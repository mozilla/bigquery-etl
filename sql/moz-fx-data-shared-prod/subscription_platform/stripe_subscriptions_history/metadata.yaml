friendly_name: Stripe subscriptions history
description: "History of changes to Stripe subscriptions as recorded by Fivetran,\
  \ with revisions to improve historical accuracy.\n\nTo get the historical state\
  \ at a particular point in time use a condition like the following:\n  valid_from\
  \ <= {timestamp}\n  AND valid_to > {timestamp}\n\nThis table's schema closely mirrors\
  \ Stripe's subscriptions API (https://stripe.com/docs/api/subscriptions/object).\n\
  Fields which Fivetran doesn't sync and fields we've specifically chosen not to include\
  \ (e.g. PII) have been omitted.\nIn particular, all address fields except country\
  \ have been omitted because Firefox Account user IDs are present and this is in\
  \ a Mozilla-confidential dataset.\n\nSome caveats:\n  * We only have partial data\
  \ for Stripe subscriptions prior to March 2023 due to a data loss incident (DENG-754)."
