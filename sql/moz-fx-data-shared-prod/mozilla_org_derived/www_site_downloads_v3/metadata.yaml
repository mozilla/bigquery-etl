  Aggregated download counts for www.mozilla.org from Google Analytics 4
  Note: GA4 tends to have attribution information nested within events in a session,
  and this attribution info isn't always on the download event itself
  For example, this table contains columns that are on the event itself;
  for example, campaign_from_event_params & source_from_event_params.
  It also contains columns that say, what was the first seen source of attribution across all the events
  in that session, such as first_campaign_from_event_params_in_session & first_source_from_event_params_in_session
