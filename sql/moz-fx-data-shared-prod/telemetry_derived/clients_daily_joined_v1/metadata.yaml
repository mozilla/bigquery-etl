friendly_name: Clients Daily Joined
description: |-
  Daily per-client aggregations joined from multiple ping types.

  The clients_daily_v6 table is based on main pings only and serves as the
  "driver" here, defining all the dimensions like geo, etc. We then do a
  left join on clients_daily_event_v1 to pull in activity measures based on
  event pings. A given client will appear in this table on a given only if
  we received a main ping from that client on that day. The first_seen_date
  and second_seen_date is added to each client from clients_last_seen.
