/*

Daily install statistics to power AMO stats pages. See Bug 1572873.

This query looks backward in time by two days in order to allow
some delay in installs actually being reported, which means each
submission_date partition actually reflects installs from two days
prior. We adjust for this in the user-facing view on top of this
table (telemetry.amo_stats_installs), where we replace
`submission_date` with `install_date`.
