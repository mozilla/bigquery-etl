  Return the position of the rightmost set bit in an INT64 bit pattern.

  To determine this position, we take a bitwise AND of the bit pattern and
  its complement, then we determine the position of the bit via base-2
  logarithm; see https://stackoverflow.com/a/42747608/1260237

  See detailed docs for the bits28 suite of functions:
