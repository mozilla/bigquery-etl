friendly_name: FxA GCP stderr events (prod)
description: |
  FxA server events extracted from stderr logs.
  This new table is the direct result of FxA migration from AWS to GCP
  (see: OPST-296 for more context).
  Traffic shifting from AWS to GCP started on 2023-09-07 and finished on 2023-09-12 and this table contains partial
  event data for these days. Once the migration is complete all events from the fxa auth server will land in this table
  (previous table: `fxa_auth_events_v1`).

  Note that at the time of writing there is an open ticket (https://mozilla-hub.atlassian.net/browse/FXA-8315)
  to standardize logging across fxa packages. If resolved, auth server events might land in `fxa_gcp_stdout_events_v1` instead.
  This should be transparent to users of this data since it should be consumed via `fxa_all_events` view.

  Payment server events will continue landing inside: `fxa_stdout_events_v1`
