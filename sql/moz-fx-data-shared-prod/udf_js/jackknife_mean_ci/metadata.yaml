description: Calculates a confidence interval using a jackknife resampling
  technique for the mean of an array of values for various buckets;
  see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackknife_resampling  Users must
  specify the number of expected buckets as the first parameter to guard against
  the case where empty buckets lead to an array with missing elements.  Usage
  generally involves first calculating an aggregate per bucket, then
  aggregating over buckets, passing ARRAY_AGG(metric) to this function.
