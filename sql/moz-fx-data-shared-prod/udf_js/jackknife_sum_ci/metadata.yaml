description: 'Calculates a confidence interval using a jackknife resampling
technique for the sum of an array of counts for various buckets;

  must specify the number of expected buckets as the first parameter
  to guard against the case where empty buckets lead to an array with missing
  elements.  Usage generally involves first calculating an aggregate count per
  bucket, then aggregating over buckets, passing ARRAY_AGG(metric) to this
  function.  Example:  WITH bucketed AS
  (   SELECT     submission_date,     SUM(dau) AS dau_sum   FROM     mytable
  GROUP BY     submission_date,     bucket_id ) SELECT   submission_date,
  udf_js.jackknife_sum_ci(ARRAY_AGG(dau_sum)).*
  FROM   bucketed GROUP BY   submission_date'
