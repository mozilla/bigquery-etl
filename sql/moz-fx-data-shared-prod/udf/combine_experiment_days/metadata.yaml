description: The "clients_last_seen" class of tables represent various types
  of client activity within a 28-day window as bit patterns.  This function
  takes in two arrays of structs where each entry gives the bit pattern for
  days in which we saw a ping for a given user in a given experiment. We
  combine the bit patterns for the previous day and the current day, returning
  a single array of experiment structs.
