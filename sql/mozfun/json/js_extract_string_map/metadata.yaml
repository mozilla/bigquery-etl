friendly_name: JSON Extract String Map
description: |-
  Returns an array of key/value structs from a string representing a JSON map.

  BigQuery Standard SQL JSON functions are insufficient to implement this
  function, so JS is being used and it may not perform well with large or
  numerous inputs.

  Non-string non-null values are encoded as json.
