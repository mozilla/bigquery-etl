friendly_name: Gecko Trace Traces
description: |-
  Complete traces from Gecko across all Firefox applications.

  This view provides a unified interface to trace data from multiple Firefox
  applications including Firefox Desktop, Firefox for Android (Fenix Nightly),
  and Firefox for Android (Beta). Each row represents a complete trace with
  an additional application field to identify the source.

  Each trace contains a hierarchical tree structure of spans with their
  parent-child relationships preserved in the root_span field. This enables
  analysis of complete execution flows, performance bottlenecks, and
  behavioral patterns across different Firefox applications. The signature
  field allows grouping traces with similar execution patterns for
  comparative performance analysis.
