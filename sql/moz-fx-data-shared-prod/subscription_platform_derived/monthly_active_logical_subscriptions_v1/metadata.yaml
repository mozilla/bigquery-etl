friendly_name: Monthly active logical subscriptions
description: |-
  Monthly snapshots of logical subscriptions that were active at any point during each month.
  The latest state of the subscription during the month is saved.

  This ETL is delayed by 7 extra days to allow more time for possible late-arriving data.
  More recent data that is still in flux can be found in `recent_monthly_active_logical_subscriptions_v1`.

  Logical subscriptions are a continuous active period for a particular provider subscription.
