friendly_name: Monthly active service subscriptions
description: |-
  Monthly snapshots of service subscriptions that were active at any point during each month.
  The latest state of the subscription during the month is saved.

  Service subscriptions are a continuous active period for a specific service by a particular provider subscription.

  Some caveats:
    * This ETL is delayed by 7 extra days to allow more time for possible late-arriving data.
      More recent data that is still in flux can be found in `recent_monthly_active_service_subscriptions_v1`.
    * We only have partial data for Stripe subscriptions prior to March 2023 due to a data loss incident (DENG-754).
