friendly_name: {{ app_value }} Active Users Aggregates
description: |-
  This table contains dau, wau, mau, daily users,
  weekly users and monthly users for {{ app_value }},
  aggregated by submission_date, attribution, channel,
  country, city, device model, distribution_id, os details
  and activity segment.

  - dau is counting the users who reported a ping on the date and
  are qualified as active users.
  - daily_users counts all the users who reported a ping on the date.
  Only dau is exposed in the view telemetry.active_users_aggregates.

  The table is labeled as "change_controlled", which implies
  that changes require the approval of at least one owner.
  
  The label "shredder mitigation" indicates that this table is set up for
  managed backfill with shredder mitigation, as described in
  https://mozilla.github.io/bigquery-etl/cookbooks/creating_a_derived_dataset/#initiating-the-backfill.
