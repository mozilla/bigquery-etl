friendly_name: Combine Experiment Days
description: |-
  The "clients_last_seen" class of tables represent various types of client activity within a 28-day window as bit patterns.  This function takes in two arrays of structs where each entry gives the bit pattern for days in which we saw a ping for a given user in a given experiment. We combine the bit patterns for the previous day and the current day, returning a single array of experiment structs.
