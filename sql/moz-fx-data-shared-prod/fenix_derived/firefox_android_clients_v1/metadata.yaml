friendly_name: Firefox Android Clients
description: |-
  Contains a list of Firefox Android clients along with their first attributes
  retrieved from baseline, first_session and metrics pings.

  This includes information such as their initial geo, OS, ISP, and attribution info.

  For analysis purposes, use first_seen_date to query clients that
  effectively appeared on that date. The submission_date indicates
  when the server received the data.

  Note that the query for this table overwrites the whole table instead of writing to
  a single partition.

  Proposal:
  https://docs.google.com/document/d/12bj4DhCybelqHVgOVq8KJlzgtbbUw3f68palNrv-gaM/.

  For more details about attribution and campaign structure see:

  WARNING:
  In case of backfilling the table it is suggested to re-initialize the table instead of using the backfill command
  to avoid hitting the "partitions quota limits exceeded" error using the following command:

  ./bqetl query initialize sql/moz-fx-data-shared-prod/fenix_derived/firefox_android_clients_v1/query.sql
owners:
- lvargas@mozilla.com
labels:
  application: firefox_android
  # This query results in the table being rebuilt on each run
  # by combining mix of all old and new records, in some cases combining them together.
