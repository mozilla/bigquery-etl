friendly_name: Firefox Android Clients
description: |-
  Contains a list of Firefox Android clients along with their first attributes
  retrieved from baseline, first_session and metrics pings.

  This includes information such as their initial geo, OS, ISP, and attribution info.

  For analysis purposes, use first_seen_date to query clients that
  effectively appeared on that date. The submission_date indicates
  when the server received the data.

  Note that the query for the underlying table this view references
  overwrites the whole table instead of writing to a single partition.
