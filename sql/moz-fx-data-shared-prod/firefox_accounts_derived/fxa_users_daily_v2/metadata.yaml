friendly_name: FxA Users Daily
description: |
  Derived from fxa_users_services (user/service level) and aggregated
  to the user level. If the user had multiple different entries on a single day,
  then we grab the attributes from the first service observed that day.
  This includes information about which users were active on a specific day
  along with some attributes related to that user.
  See the schema for a list of attributes and their descriptions.

  This lower level model uses the following category of events:
  event_category IN ('auth', 'auth_bounce', 'content', 'oauth')
