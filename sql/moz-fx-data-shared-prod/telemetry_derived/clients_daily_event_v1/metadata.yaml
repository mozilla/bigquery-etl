friendly_name: Clients Daily Event
description: |-
  Daily per-client aggregations based on desktop event pings.
  We maintain no dimensions like geo or even release channel in this table
  as those are all calculated in the main ping-based clients_daily.
  We join main ping and event data together in clients_daily_joined_v1,
  which then becomes the source for the user-facing view.
