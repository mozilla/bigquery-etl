description: Returns a bitmask that can be used to return a subset
  of an integer representing a bit array. The start_ordinal argument
  is an integer specifying the starting position of the slice, with
  start_ordinal = 1 indicating the first bit. The length argument
  is the number of bits to include in the mask.  The arguments were chosen
  to match the semantics of the SUBSTR function;
