friendly_name: Braze Users Previous Day Snapshot
description: |-
  This is a snapshot of the users table at the state it was in before
  the most recent DAG run. Since the user profiles table updates three times a day at
  0500, 1300, & 2100 UTC, we can update this snapshot looking 1 hour back (to capture the state
  prior to this run).

  This snapshot allows us to compare changed values in order to generate the
  JSON payloads for Braze's cloud data ingestion tool.
