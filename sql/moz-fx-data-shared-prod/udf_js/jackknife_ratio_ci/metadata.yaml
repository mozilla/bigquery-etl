description: "Calculates a confidence interval using a jackknife resampling
  technique for the weighted mean of an array of ratios for various buckets;
  see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackknife_resampling  Users must specify
  the number of expected buckets as the first parameter to guard against
  the case where empty buckets lead to an array with missing elements.
  Usage generally involves first calculating an aggregate per bucket, then
  aggregating over buckets, passing ARRAY_AGG(metric) to this function.
  Example:  WITH bucketed AS (   SELECT     submission_date,
  SUM(active_days_in_week) AS active_days_in_week,     SUM(wau) AS wau
  FROM     mytable   GROUP BY     submission_date,     bucket_id
  ) SELECT   submission_date,   udf_js.jackknife_ratio_ci(20,
  ARRAY_AGG(STRUCT(CAST(active_days_in_week AS float64),
  CAST(wau as FLOAT64)))) AS intensity FROM   bucketed GROUP BY
  submission_date"
