description: 'Given a BYTES, return the number of days since the
  client was last seen.  If no bits are set, returns NULL, indicating
  we don''t know. Otherwise the results are 0-indexed, meaning \x01 will
  return 0.  Tests showed this being 5-10x faster than the simpler
  alternative: CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION   udf.bits_to_days_since_seen(b
  BYTES) AS ((     SELECT MIN(n)     FROM UNNEST(GENERATE_ARRAY(0, 364))
  AS n     WHERE BIT_COUNT(SUBSTR(b >> n, -1) & b''\x01'') > 0));
