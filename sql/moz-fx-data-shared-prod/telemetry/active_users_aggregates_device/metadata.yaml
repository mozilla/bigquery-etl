friendly_name: Active Users Aggregates Device
description: |-
  This aggregation contains the metrics of daily, weekly and monthly
  active users as well as new profiles and search counts in the
  context of analysing per device.

  The reason to have this aggregate in addition to active_users_aggregates
  is to improve the query performance for final users, by separating the
  analysis per device, which is the biggest size column in the table,
  as most devices have a unique identifiers.
