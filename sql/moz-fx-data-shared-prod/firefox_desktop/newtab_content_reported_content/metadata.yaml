friendly_name: Newtab-Content Reported Content
description: |-
  This model will be used by the content team to monitor organic content that users have reported on an hourly basis.
  This will help assist the content team in identifying and removing problematic content faster. Data from the same day
  will be reprocessed every hour until 1:00am the following day to allow for late arriving data. Therefore, data for that
  day will first be available at 2:00am.
