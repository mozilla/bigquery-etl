friendly_name: Events Last Seen
description: >
  Used to define bit patterns on top of events that represent usage of desktop
  features over 28-day windows. Includes no dimensions, since these fields are intended
  to be joined in as part of the clients_last_seen query.

  Note that the join with clients_last_seen is a LEFT JOIN to avoid allowing rows
  where no main pings have been seen. As a result, clients_last_seen will not reflect
  any events which arrive on the date before the first main ping is received.
