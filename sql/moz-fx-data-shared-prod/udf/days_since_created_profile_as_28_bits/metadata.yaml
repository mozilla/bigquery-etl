description: Takes in a difference between submission date and
  profile creation date
  and returns a bit pattern representing the profile creation
  date IFF the profile
  date is the same as the submission date or no more than 6 days
  earlier. Analysis has shown that client-reported profile creation
  dates are much less reliable outside of this range and cannot be
  used as reliable indicators of new profile creation.
