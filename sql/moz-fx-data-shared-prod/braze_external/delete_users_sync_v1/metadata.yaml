friendly_name: Braze Delete Users Sync
description: |-
  Users added to this table are deleted in Braze. Deleted users
  can be a result of the following actions:

  - User data deletion request
  - User added to suppression list
  - User requested FxA deletion - this logic is currently under
  discussion and may change. The FxA/Basket/FxA teams are discussing
  adding an option for users to also unsubscribe from newsletters
  to grant agency.
