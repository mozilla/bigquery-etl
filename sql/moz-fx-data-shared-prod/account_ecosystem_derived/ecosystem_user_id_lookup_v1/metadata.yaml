friendly_name: Ecosystem User ID Lookup
description: >
  Lookup table of ecosystem_user_id to canonical_id.

  The canonical_id is the first ecosystem_user_id value observed for each user.
  Each ecosystem_user_id ever observed is guaranteed to appear exactly once.
  Many ecosystem_user_id values may map to the same canonical_id since the
  value associated with a user changes whenever the user changes their password.
