        This doesn''t have units, it''s just useful for comparing two checkerboard
        events to see which one is worse, for some implementation-specific definition
        of "worse". The larger the value, the worse the checkerboarding.

        This is the union of two possibly-intersecting sets of time periods: The first
        set is that in which checkerboarding was actually happening, since by definition
        it could potentially be happening. The second set is that in which the APZC
        is actively transforming content in the compositor, since it could potentially
        transform it so as to display checkerboarding to the user. Combined with other

        enncounters checkerboarding.

        Notably, this duration omits the time from process start to the

        initializer (which includes a lengthy dex operation) and the time from

        the first frame to visual completeness. This probe doesn''t measure Custom

        Tabs or other uses of `ExternalAppBrowserActivity` to simplify result

        analysis. The methodology for determining this measurement is imperfect

        to simplify implementation. Issues may include:

        <br>- Not measuring Beta and Release channels (due to

        `MigrationDecisionActivity` interrupting the logic).

        <br>- Not distinguishing between MAIN to homescreen, onboarding, session

        restore, others?

        <br>- Not choosing to record a MAIN based on what the user would see and

        thus the core code path (i.e. the thing we want to measure) but rather on

        the initial `Intent` state.
