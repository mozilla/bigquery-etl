# This table is still being populated with data from the payments server
# due to the fact that it was deployed in GCP prior to the AWS -> GCP migration
# and was set up to route its data to the fxa_prod_logs.stdout inside the old FxA GCP project.
# Until this routing is updated, we need to keep this task running.
