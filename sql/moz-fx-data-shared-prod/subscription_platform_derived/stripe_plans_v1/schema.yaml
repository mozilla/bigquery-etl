fields:
- name: id
  type: STRING
  mode: NULLABLE
  description: Unique identifier for the plan.
- name: product_id
  type: STRING
  mode: NULLABLE
  description: ID of the product whose pricing this plan determines.
- name: created
  type: TIMESTAMP
  mode: NULLABLE
  description: Time at which the plan was created.

  description: Whether the plan can be used for new purchases.
- name: aggregate_usage
  type: STRING
  mode: NULLABLE
  description: Specifies a usage aggregation strategy for plans of `usage_type` =
    "metered". Allowed values are "sum" for summing up all usage during a period,
    "last_during_period" for using the last usage record reported within a period,
    "last_ever" for using the last usage record ever (across period bounds) or "max"
    which uses the usage record with the maximum reported usage during a period.
- name: amount
  type: INTEGER
  mode: NULLABLE
  description: The unit amount in cents to be charged, represented as a whole integer
    if possible. Only set if `billing_scheme` = "per_unit".
- name: billing_scheme
  type: STRING
  mode: NULLABLE
  description: Describes how to compute the price per period. Either "per_unit" or
    "tiered". "per_unit" indicates that the fixed amount (specified in `amount`) will
    be charged per unit in `quantity` (for plans with `usage_type` = "licensed"),
    or per unit of total usage (for plans with `usage_type` = "metered"). "tiered"
    indicates that the unit pricing will be computed using a tiering strategy as defined
    using the `tiers` and `tiers_mode` attributes.
- name: currency
  type: STRING
  mode: NULLABLE
  description: Three-letter ISO currency code, in lowercase.
- name: interval
  type: STRING
  mode: NULLABLE
  description: The frequency at which a subscription is billed. One of "day", "week",

- name: interval_count
  type: INTEGER

  mode: NULLABLE
  description: Set of key-value pairs attached to the plan, stored as a JSON object.
- name: nickname
  type: STRING
  mode: NULLABLE
  description: A brief description of the plan, hidden from customers.
- name: tiers_mode
  type: STRING
  mode: NULLABLE
  description: Defines if the tiering price should be "graduated" or "volume". In
    volume-based tiering, the maximum quantity within a period determines the per
    unit price. In graduated tiering, pricing can change as the quantity grows.
- name: trial_period_days
  type: INTEGER
  mode: NULLABLE
  description: Default number of trial days when subscribing a customer to this plan
    using `trial_from_plan=true`.
- name: usage_type
  type: STRING
  mode: NULLABLE
  description: Configures how the quantity per period should be determined. Can be
    either "metered" or "licensed". "licensed" automatically bills the `quantity`
    set when adding it to a subscription. "metered" aggregates the total usage based
    on usage records. Defaults to "licensed".
