  This contains a set aggregated metrics that correlate to internet
  outages for different countries in the world.

  The dataset contains the following fields:
    - `country`: the Country code of the client.
    - `city`: the City name (only for cities with a population >= 15000,
    'unknown' otherwise).
    - `datetime`: the date and the time (truncated to hour) the data was
    submitted by the client.
    - `proportion_undefined`: the proportion of users who failed to send
    telemetry for a reason that was not listed in the other cases.
    - `proportion_timeout`: the proportion of users that had their connection
    timeout while uploading telemetry
    ([after 90s, in Firefox Desktop](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/fa2df28a49883612bd7af4dacd80cdfedcccd2f6/toolkit/components/telemetry/app/TelemetrySend.jsm#81)).
    - `proportion_abort`: the proportion of users that had their connection
    terminated by the client (for example, terminating open connections before
    shutting down).
    - `proportion_unreachable`: the proportion of users that failed to upload
    telemetry because the server was not reachable (e.g. because the host was
    not reachable, proxy problems or OS waking up after a suspension).
    - `proportion_terminated`: the proportion of users that had their connection
    terminated internally by the networking code.
    - `proportion_channel_open`: the proportion of users for which the upload
    request was terminated immediately, by the client, because of a Necko
    internal error.
    - `avg_dns_success_time`: the average time it takes for a successful DNS
    resolution, in milliseconds.
    - `missing_dns_success`: counts how many sessions did not report the
    `DNS_LOOKUP_TIME` histogram.
    - `avg_dns_failure_time`: the average time it takes for an unsuccessful DNS
    resolution, in milliseconds.
    - `missing_dns_failure`: counts how many sessions did not report the
    `DNS_FAILED_LOOKUP_TIME` histogram.
    - `count_dns_failure`: the average count of unsuccessful DNS resolutions
    reported.
    - `ssl_error_prop`: the proportion of users that reported an error through
    the `SSL_CERT_VERIFICATION_ERRORS` histogram.
    - `avg_tls_handshake_time`: the average time after the TCP SYN to ready
    for HTTP, in milliseconds.

  Caveats with the data:
  As with any observational data, there are many caveats and interpretation must
  be done carefully. Below is a list of issues we have considered, but it is not
  exhaustive.
    - Firefox users are not representative of the general population in their
    region.
    - Users can experience multiple types of failures and so the proportions
    are not summable. For example, if 2.4% of clients had a timeout and 2.6% of
    clients had eUnreachable that doesn't necessarily mean that 5.0% of clients
    had a timeout or a eUnreachable
    - Geographical data is based on IPGeo databases. These databases are
    imperfect, so some activity may be attributed to the wrong location.
    Further, proxy and VPN usage can create geo-attribution errors.
