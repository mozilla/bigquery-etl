friendly_name: FxA Log Device Command Events
description: |-
  A subset of FxA auth server logs related to "send tab" activity.
  See https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1649074

  This table contains event data from the FxA service when it was still running in AWS.
  All new events come from GCP deployment of FxA and are available in the v2 of this table.
  The migration started on 2023-09-07 and was concluded by 2023-09-15.
