  Extract bits from a byte array. Roughly matches substr
  with three arguments:
    b: bytes - The byte string we need to extract from
    start: int - The position of the first bit we want to extract.
      Can be negative to start from the end of the byte array.
      One-indexed, like substring.
    length: int - The number of bits we want to extract

  The return byte array will have CEIL(length/8) bytes. The bits of
  interest will start at the beginning of the byte string. In other words,
  the byte array will have trailing 0s for any non-relevant fields.

  Examples:
  bytes.extract_bits(b'\x0F\xF0', 5, 8) = b'\xFF'
  bytes.extract_bits(b'\x0C\xC0', -12, 8) = b'\xCC'
