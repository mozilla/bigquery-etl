friendly_name: FxA Users Services Devices First Seen
description: |
  Usage aggregations describing when each FxA user, service,
  device_id combination was first seen by us and some
  attributes associated with this first session.
  Note: registration or login events are used to
  determine the first session.

  Additional attributes get captured to provide insight into
  what os and browser is used by the new device, as well as,
  the device's entrypoint and utm information.
  This information is static and represents as was at the time
  (does not change).

  Lowest granularity field: device_id

  Notes:
    - There are very few cases when a single flow_id
      can contain multiple device_ids.
    - utm fields contain very high levels of null values.
