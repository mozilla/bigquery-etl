description: |-
  A daily run of the KPI forecasting package Mozaic Forecasting. This
  contains actual training data and forecasted future predictions, along
  with information about segments and training details. See the proposal
  for more. If you aren't certain that you want forecasted data, you
  probably don't because these values may or may not reflect reality.
