  Create a view that queries the `events_daily` table.
  This view currently supports both funnels and event
  counts.

  Funnels are created as a struct, with each step in the
  funnel as a boolean column in the struct, indicating
  whether the user completed that step on that day.

  Event counts are simply integers.
