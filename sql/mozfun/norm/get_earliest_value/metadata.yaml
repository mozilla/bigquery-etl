friendly_name: Get Earliest Value
description: |
  This UDF returns the earliest not-null value pair and datetime
  from a list of values and their corresponding timestamp.

  The function will return the first value pair in the input array,
  that is not null and has the earliest timestamp.

  Because there may be more than one value on the same date e.g. more
  than one value reported by different pings on the same date, the dates
  must be given as TIMESTAMPS and the values as STRING.
