friendly_name: Get Earliest Value
description: |
  This UDF returns the earliest not-null value from a set of 3 values.

  The order is not important as the function will return the first value
  that is not null and has the earliest timestamp.

  Because there may be more than one value on the same date e.g. more than
  one value reported by different pings on the same date, the dates
  must be given as TIMESTAMPS and the values as STRING.
