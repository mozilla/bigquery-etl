friendly_name: Unified Metrics
description: |-
  Unified view on common browser metrics across all products.

  Note. From Q4/2022 the app name includes the suffix ` Glean`
  to differentiate data collected via Glean from the data
  collected in Legavy Telemetry, until the migration to use only
  Glean is complete.
  For this reason is important to query this table always
  using the view, which retrieves the correct dataset.
