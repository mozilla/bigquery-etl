friendly_name: Clients Last Seen Joined
description: |-
  Captures history of activity of each client in 28 day
  windows for each submission date, pulling usage criteria
  from multiple ping types.

  The clients_last_seen_v6 table is based on main pings only and serves as the
  "driver" here, defining all the dimensions like geo, etc. We then do a
  left join on clients_last_seen_event_v1 to pull in activity measures based on
  event pings. A given client will appear in this table on a given only if
  we received a main ping from that client on that day or in the preceding
  27 days.
