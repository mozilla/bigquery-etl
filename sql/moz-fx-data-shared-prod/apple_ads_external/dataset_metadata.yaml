  Queries for copying over Apple ads data from our Fivetran
  project over to our data BQ project.

  The fivetran tables being copied over are not raw ingested tables,
  but instead tables that have been transformed using fivetran transformations
  power by our DBT project:
  https://github.com/mozilla/dbt-fivetran-transformations/

  More information on how these models are built can be found here:
