friendly_name: Bits From Offsets
description: >
  Returns a bit pattern of type BYTES compactly encoding the given array of
  positive integer offsets.

  This is primarily useful to generate a compact encoding of dates on which
  a feature was used, with arbitrarily long history. Example aggregation:

  ```sql
  bits_from_offsets(
    ARRAY_AGG(IF(foo, DATE_DIFF(anchor_date, submission_date, DAY), NULL)
              IGNORE NULLS)
  )
  ```

  The resulting value can be cast to an INT64 representing the most recent 64
  days via:

  ```sql
  CAST(CONCAT('0x', TO_HEX(RIGHT(bits >> i, 4))) AS INT64)
  ```

  Or representing the most recent 28 days (compatible with bits28 functions)
  via:

  ```sql
  CAST(CONCAT('0x', TO_HEX(RIGHT(bits >> i, 4))) AS INT64) << 36 >> 36
  ```
