-- PLEASE create the table using the ./bqetl deploy command
-- then run this query and append the results to it.
--
-- Running init.sql to generate the initial table vs schema + backfill approach
-- allows us to save a lot of time as we do not have to re-run the query for each partition date
-- instead all partitions to date could be used to generate the table and have the ETL take over.
