friendly_name: Json Extract Missing Cols
description: |-
  Extract missing columns from additional properties.  More generally, get a list of nodes from a JSON blob. Array elements are indicated as [...].  param input: The JSON blob to explode param indicates_node: An array of strings. If a key's value is an object, and contains one of these values, that key is returned as a node. param known_nodes: An array of strings. If a key is in this array, it is returned as a node.  Notes: - Use indicates_node for things like histograms. For example ['histogram_type'] will ensure that each histogram will be returned as a missing node, rather than the subvalues within the histogram   (e.g. values, sum, etc.) - Use known_nodes if you're aware of a missing section, like ['simpleMeasurements']  See here for an example usage https://sql.telemetry.mozilla.org/queries/64460/source
