friendly_name: Normalized Difference in Months
description: >
  Determine the number of whole months after grace period between start and end.
  Month is dependent on timezone, so start and end must both be datetimes, or
  both be dates, in the correct timezone. Grace period can be used to account
  for billing delay, usually 1 day, and is counted after months. When inclusive
  is FALSE, start and end are not included in whole months.

  For example, diff_months(start => '2021-01-01', end => '2021-03-01',
  grace_period => INTERVAL 0 day, inclusive => FALSE) returns 1, because start
  plus two months plus grace period is not less than end. Changing inclusive to
  TRUE returns 2, because start plus two months plus grace period is less than
  or equal to end. diff_months(start => '2021-01-01', end => '2021-03-02
  00:00:00.000001', grace_period => INTERVAL 1 DAY, inclusive => FALSE) returns
  2, because start plus two months plus grace period is less than end.
