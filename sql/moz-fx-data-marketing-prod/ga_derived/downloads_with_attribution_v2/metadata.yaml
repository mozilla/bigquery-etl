  A daily joining of Firefox download tokens with Google Analytics attribution data.
  Due to delays in GA session reporting this table has a total 3 day lag. This is due to a combination of delayed data
  from GA, end of day processing in ETL and the need to check GA sessions a day later for the download attribution.
  e.g Data for 2023-04-05 will not be available until 2023-04-08

  1. Each row in this table is a unique dltoken.

  2. A single GA session can have multiple dltokens (a session resulted in multiple downloads).

  3. The two datasets are first joined using the GA client_id and a custom download_session_id (v2 implementatin).

  4. If either the stub_visit_id or stub_download_session_id is NULL, '', '(not set)', or 'something',
    the join_result_v2 column is:
    * DOWNLOAD_CLIENT_OR_SESSION_ID_NULL
    * DOWNLOAD_CLIENT_OR_SESSION_ID_EMPTY
    * DOWNLOAD_CLIENT_OR_SESSION_ID_VALUE_NOT_SET
    * DOWNLOAD_CLIENT_OR_SESSION_ID_VALUE_SOMETHING
    * All GA derived values are null
    * The join_result_v1 is null

  5. The join_result_v2 column is CLIENT_ID_SESSION_ID_MATCH for a successful join and join_result_v1 is null since the
      v1 logic was not applied.

  6. Occasionally GA sessions do not include a download_session_id only the client_id but the download data has both
      theclient_id and the download_session_id.  Because of the missing GA field the join does not match resulting in
      ~7000 dltoken rows with join_result_v2 = MISSING_GA_CLIENT_OR_SESSION_ID.  When this result is detected, the join
      is performed again for only those dltokens using the client_id only (V1 implementation).  This may result in a
      few hundred MISSING_GA_CLIENT occurring along with GA_UNRESOLVABLE due to multiple GA sessions for the selected
      time range.

  7.  In all cases where v1 logic has been applied, the join_result_v2 is set to MISSING_GA_CLIENT_OR_SESSION_ID

  8.  If the v1 logic is applied, the join_result_v1 column will be CLIENT_ID_ONLY_MATCH for a successful join.

  9. A GA session which does not have a dltoken with a corresponding stub_visit_id/clientId match is excluded from this
      dataset.

  10. If a dltoken occurs in the raw stub attribution table more than once:
    * count_dltoken_duplicates will be >= 1.
    * A value of 0 means there are no duplicates (expected state).
    * A value of 1 means there was 1 other row with the dltoken value, etc.
