  Interpolate missing histogram buckets with empty buckets so it becomes a valid
  estimator for the dirichlet distribution.

  Aggregate the histograms to the client level, to get a histogram {k1: p1,
  k2:p2} where the p's are proportions(and p1, p2 sum to 1). This is then the
  client's estimated density. So every client is reduced to one row (i.e the
  client's histograms are reduced to this single density). How can we create a
  final estimator for the histogram density?

  For every client, compute the density i.e. {k1:p1, k2:p2 }. Add all of these
  across clients to get {k1: P1, k2:P2} where P1 = sum(p1 across clients) and P2
  = sum(p2 across clients). We also compute the number of buckets K (in this
  example K=2) We also compute total number of profiles `nreporting`. Then our
  estimate for final density is {k1: (P1+1/K) / (nreporting+1), k2:(P2+1/K) /
  (nreporting+1)}
