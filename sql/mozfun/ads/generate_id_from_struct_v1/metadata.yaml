friendly_name: Generate Int Id From Struct
description: |
  Generate a deterministic and joinable INT64 identifier from the input STRUCT.
  
  Useful to match records across systems with different schemas and optimize the
  storage and join in source of truth tables.
  
  This UDF is used in Ads workspace to generate ad_ids using different sources (with or
  without an id in the source). We don't use ABS to prevent risk of collision of ids. 
  
  Important
  - STRING fields are trimmed, lowercased and NULLs are replaced with empty strings.
  - Input. The input must be a typed STRUCTs without missing fields and in a fixed order.
  - Output. Returns a signed 64-bit integer as the generated ID and the version of
   the UDF which can be used for backfills on different dates.
  ==================================================================================
  - Changes. If you need to use a different logic e.g. adding or removing fields:
    - Bump this UDF version.
    - Create a dispatcher UDF to return the correct UDF version to use in each case.
    This ensures consistency and using the correct version during backfills & joins.
