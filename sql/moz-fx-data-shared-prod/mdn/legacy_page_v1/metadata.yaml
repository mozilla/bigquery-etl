friendly_name: MDN Legacy Page pings
description: |-
  This view unions Yari page pings (`mdn_yari.page`) with Fred page_load
  events (`mdn_fred.events_stream`), reshaped to match the Yari ping schema.

  Yari data mainly covers the MDN frontend before Fred's launch on 2025-08-19,
  but it also continues to cover MDN Plus usage after that date.

  The goal of this view is to ease migration of existing queries against `mdn_yari.page`.

  For new queries that do not require data before 2025-08-19 or MDN Plus data,
  prefer using `mdn_fred.events_stream` directly.
