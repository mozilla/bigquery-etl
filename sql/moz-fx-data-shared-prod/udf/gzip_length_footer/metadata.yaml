description: 'Given a gzip compressed byte string, extract the uncompressed
  size from the footer.  WARNING: THIS FUNCTION IS NOT RELIABLE FOR
  ARBITRARY GZIP STREAMS. It should, however, be safe to use for checking
  the decompressed size of payload in payload_bytes_decoded (and NOT
  payload_bytes_raw) because that payload is produced by the decoder and
  limited to conditions where the footer is accurate.
  From https://stackoverflow.com/a/9213826
  First, the only information about the uncompressed length is four bytes at
  the end of the gzip file (stored in little-endian order). By necessity,
  that is the length modulo 232. So if the uncompressed length is 4 GB or
  more, you won''t know what the length is. You can only be certain that the
  uncompressed length is less than 4 GB if the compressed length is less than
  something like 232 / 1032 + 18, or around 4 MB. (1032 is the maximum
  compression factor of deflate.) Second, and this is worse, a gzip file may
  actually be a concatenation of multiple gzip streams. Other than decoding,
  there is no way to find where each gzip stream ends in order to look at the
  four-byte uncompressed length of that piece. (Which may be wrong anyway due
  to the first reason.) Third, gzip files will sometimes have junk after the
  end of the gzip stream (usually zeros). Then the last four bytes are not the
  length.'
