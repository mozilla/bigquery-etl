description: Combines two bit patterns. The first pattern represents activity
  over a 28-day period ending "yesterday". The second pattern represents
  activity as observed today (usually just 0 or 1). We shift the bits in the
  first pattern by one to set the new baseline as "today", then perform a
  bitwise OR of the two patterns.
