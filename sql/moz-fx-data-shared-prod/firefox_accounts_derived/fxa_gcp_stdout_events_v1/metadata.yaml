friendly_name: FxA GCP stdout events (prod)
description: |
  FxA server events extracted from stdout logs.
  This new table is the direct result of FxA migration from AWS to GCP
  (see: OPST-296 for more context).
  Traffic shifting from AWS to GCP started on 2023-09-07 and this table contains partial event data starting from this date.
  Once the migration is complete all events from the fxa content server will land in this table
  (previous table: `fxa_content_events_v1`).

  See also `fxa_gcp_stderr_events_v1`.

  Payment server events will continue landing inside: `fxa_stdout_events_v1`
