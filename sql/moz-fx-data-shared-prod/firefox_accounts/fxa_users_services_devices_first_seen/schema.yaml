    in will have a different value for device_id. This should be treated more like

    a session identified (in our case, session does not expire).

    There are two ways in which device_id field value gets populated/generated:

    1. If the current flow session does not have a device_id associated with it we
    set

    it to the device_id/deviceId value found inside urlParams object.

    2. If during the above process we find urlParams object to not have this attribute
    set,

    then we use uuid.v4() to generate a new unique value and assign it to deviceId
    flow session.
