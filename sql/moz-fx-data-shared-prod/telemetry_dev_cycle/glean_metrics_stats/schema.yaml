  description: 'Date the metric is no longer collected. This is calculated with both
    the last_date ad the expires column. After the expiration date even if data is
    still sent, it is not stored, so later days will be ignored in the data collection.
    If the expiration is set for later but we don''t get any new data this indicates
    that the metric is removed from the code and therefor also expired.
