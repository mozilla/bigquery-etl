friendly_name: Truncate Version
description: |
  Truncates a version string like `<major>.<minor>.<patch>` to
  either the major or minor version. The return value is `NUMERIC`,
  which means that you can sort the results without fear (e.g. 100
  will be categorized as greater than 80, which isn't the case when
  sorting lexigraphically).

  For example, "5.1.0" would be translated to `5.1` if the parameter is
  "minor" or `5` if the parameter is major.

  If the version is only a major and/or minor version, then it will be left
  unchanged (for example "10" would stay as `10` when run through this
  function, no matter what the arguments).

  This is useful for grouping Linux and Mac operating system versions inside
  aggregate datasets or queries where there may be many different patch
  releases in the field.
