/*

Returns a parsed struct from a JSON string representing a histogram.

The built-in BigQuery JSON parsing functions are not powerful enough to handle
all the logic here, so we resort to some string processing. This function could
behave unexpectedly on poorly-formatted histogram JSON, but we expect that
payload validation in the data pipeline should ensure that histograms are well
formed, which gives us some flexibility here.

The only "correct" way to fully parse JSON strings in BigQuery is via JS UDFs;
we provide a JS implementation udf_json_extract_histogram_js for comparison,
but we expect that the overhead of the JS sandbox means that the pure SQL
implementation here will have better performance.
