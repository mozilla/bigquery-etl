friendly_name: Firefox Android Clients
description: |-
  First observations for Firefox Android clients of channel Release,
  retrieved from the earliest pings: baseline, first_session and metrics.
  The attributes stored in this table include the first attribution,
  device, OS and ISP details.

  This table should be accessed through the user-facing view
  `fenix.firefox_android_clients`.

  For analysis purposes, use first_seen_date to query clients that
  effectively appeared on that date. The submission_date indicates
  when the server received the data.

  The query for this table overwrites the whole table instead of writing to
  a single partition, so manual backfills must use parameter --no_partition.

  Proposal:
  https://docs.google.com/document/d/12bj4DhCybelqHVgOVq8KJlzgtbbUw3f68palNrv-gaM/.
