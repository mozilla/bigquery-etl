friendly_name: Mobile Search Clients Daily Historical
description: |-
  Previously the metrics were pulled from metrics ping, but now we are in the
  process of switching the query to pull from baseline ping.

  The cut-off date will be 2024.08.01; i.e., all the data on and before 2024.07.31
  pulls from metrics, and after 2024.07.31, pulls from baseline.

  This table contains the historical data.
