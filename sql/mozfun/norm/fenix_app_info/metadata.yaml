friendly_name: Normalize Fenix App Info
description: |
  Returns canonical, human-understandable identification info for Fenix sources.

  The Glean telemetry library for Android by design routes pings based
  on the Play Store appId value of the published application.
  As of August 2020, there have been 5 separate Play Store appId
   values associated with different builds of Fenix,
   each corresponding to different datasets in BigQuery,
  and the mapping of appId to logical app names
  (Firefox vs. Firefox Preview) and channel names
   (nightly, beta, or release) has changed over time; see the
  [spreadsheet of naming history for Mozilla's mobile browsers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18PzkzZxdpFl23__-CIO735NumYDqu7jHpqllo0sBbPA/edit#gid=0).

  This function is intended as the source of truth for how to map a
  specific ping in BigQuery to a logical app names and channel.
  It should be expected that the output of this function may evolve
  over time. If we rename a product or channel, we may choose to
  update the values here so that analyses consistently get the new name.

  The first argument (`app_id`) can be fairly fuzzy; it is tolerant
  of actual Google Play Store appId values like 'org.mozilla.firefox_beta'
  (mix of periods and underscores) as well as BigQuery dataset names
  with suffixes like 'org_mozilla_firefox_beta_stable'.

  The second argument (`app_build_id`) should be the value
  in client_info.app_build.

  The function returns a `STRUCT` that contains the logical `app_name`
  and `channel` as well as the Play Store `app_id` in the canonical
  form which would appear in Play Store URLs.

  Note that the naming of Fenix applications changed on 2020-07-03,
  so to get a continuous view of the pings associated with a logical
  app channel, you may need to union together tables from multiple
  BigQuery datasets. To see data for all Fenix channels together, it
  is necessary to union together tables from all 5 datasets.
  For basic usage information, consider using
  `telemetry.fenix_clients_last_seen` which already handles the
  union. Otherwise, see the example below as a template for how
  construct a custom union.

  Mapping of channels to datasets:

  - release: `org_mozilla_firefox`
  - beta: `org_mozilla_firefox_beta` (current) and `org_mozilla_fenix`
  - nightly: `org_mozilla_fenix` (current), `org_mozilla_fennec_aurora`,
  and `org_mozilla_fenix_nightly`
