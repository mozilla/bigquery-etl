description: 'Add fields from additional_attributes to active_addons
  in main_v4.  Return an array instead of a "map" for backwards
  compatibility.  The INT64 columns from BigQuery may be passed as
  strings, so parseInt before returning them if they will be coerced to
  BOOL.  The fields from additional_attributes due to union types: integer
  or boolean for foreignInstall and userDisabled; string or number for
  version.
