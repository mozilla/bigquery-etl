  Captures history of activity of each client in 28 day
  windows for each submission date.

  There will be one row per client per `submission_date`. A given client will
  stop appearing for new dates if they do not send a `main` ping for 28 days.

  Generally, this is a direct product of `clients_daily` and serves to make
  certain query patterns more efficient by eliminating the need for
  self-joins that would otherwise be needed to consider windows of activity.
  As an exception, it pulls in `first_seen_date` and `second_seen_date` over all
  time from `clients_first_seen` since `first_seen_date` is highly valuable for
  providing a stable definition of when a profile was created.

  See the
  [Working with Bit Patterns in Clients Last Seen](https://docs.telemetry.mozilla.org/cookbooks/clients_last_seen_bits.html)
  article on docs.telemetry.mozilla.org for more detailed notes on usage.
