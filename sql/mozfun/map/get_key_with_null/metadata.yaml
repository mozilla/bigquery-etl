friendly_name: Get Key with NULL
description: |-
  Fetch the value associated with a given key from an array of
  key/value structs.

  Because map types aren't available in BigQuery, we model maps as arrays
  of structs instead, and this function provides map-like access to such fields.
  This version matches NULL keys as well.
