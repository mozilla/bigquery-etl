friendly_name: Google subscriptions
description: |-
  Google subscriptions as recorded by SubPlat in Firestore, with revisions to improve historical accuracy.

  This table's schema closely mirrors the Google Play `purchases.subscriptions` API
  (https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/api-ref/rest/v3/purchases.subscriptions),
  though we intentionally omit some PII and SubPlat has added some custom metadata.
