friendly_name: Firefox Desktop Marketing Funnel (includes last year values)
description: |-
  PURPOSE:
  Creates a unified funnel metrics table combining web analytics (GA4) with
  Firefox telemetry data to track the full user journey:
    Visits -> Downloads -> Installs -> New Profiles -> Repeat Users -> Retained Week 4

  FUNNEL TYPES:
    - mozorg windows funnel: Windows users from mozilla.org (full funnel with installs)
    - mozorg mac funnel: Mac users from mozilla.org (no install data - Mac has no installer telemetry)
    - partner: Partner distribution channels (no visits/downloads - starts at profiles)
    - Unknown: EU countries and unattributed "other" traffic

  KEY EXCLUSIONS:
    - EU countries excluded from core funnels due to cookie banner impact on tracking
    - Existing Firefox users excluded from visits (browser != Firefox/Mozilla)
    - Internal cross-site traffic excluded (mozilla.org <-> firefox.com referrals)

  ATTRIBUTION:
    - Uses dltoken (download token) to link GA4 sessions -> installs -> profiles
    - Campaign attribution from Google Ads with campaigns_v2 fallback
    - Channel derived from campaign presence and GA4 channel grouping
