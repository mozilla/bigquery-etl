friendly_name: Sample Id
description: |-
  Stably hash a client_id to an integer between 0 and 99. This function is technically defined in SQL, but it calls a JS UDF implementation of a CRC-32 hash, so we defined it here to make it clear that its performance may be limited by BigQuery's JavaScript UDF environment.
