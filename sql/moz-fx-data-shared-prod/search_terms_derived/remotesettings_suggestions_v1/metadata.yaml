friendly_name: Remote Settings Suggestions
description: |
  A table containing the suggestions imported from Remote Settings, from the same list powering Firefox Suggest.
  Populated by the `quicksuggest2bq` scheduled task in telemetry-airflow.
  Note that this table is non-sensitive and accessible to all Mozilla. It is located in a restricted dataset only because it is conceptually related to search terms data and used as input in search terms sanitization processes.
