friendly_name: Baseline Clients First Seen
description: |-
  Captures the earliest server date that we observe a particular client in the
  baseline table. A client may have a `first_seen_date` that is earlier than the
  epoch of the baseline table; this is the result of a migration from a legacy
  data collection system. These clients are therefore not captured in this
  table.

  Clustering fields: `sample_id`

  See also: `baseline_clients_daily` and `baseline_clients_last_seen`.
