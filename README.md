BigQuery ETL
===

Bigquery UDFs and SQL queries for building derived datasets.

Recommended practices
===

- Queries
  - Should be defined in files named as `sql/table_version.sql` e.g. `sql/clients_daily_v6.sql`
  - Should not specify a project or dataset in table names to simplify testing
  - Should be (incremental)[#incremental-queries]
  - Should filter input tables on partition and clustering columns
  - Should use `_` prefix in generated column names not meant for output
  - Should not use jinja templating on the query file in Airflow
- UDFs
  - Should be used to avoid code duplication
  - Should use lower snake case names with `udf_` prefix e.g. `udf_mode_last`
  - Should be defined in files named as `udfs/function.{sql,js}` e.g. `udfs/udf_mode_last.sql`
  - Should use `SQL` over `js` for performance
  - Must not be used for incremental queries with a _mostly materialized view_ (defined below)

Incremental Queries
===

Incremental queries have these benefits:

- BigQuery billing discounts for destination table partitions not modified in
  the last 90 days
- Requires less airflow configuration
- Will have tooling to automate backfilling
- Will have tooling to replace partitions atomically to prevent duplicate data
- Will have tooling to generate an optimized _mostly materialized view_ that
  only calculates the most recent partition
  - Note: incompatible with UDFs, which are not allowed in views

Incremental queries have these properties:

- Must accept a date via `@submission_date` query parameter
  - Must output a column named `submission_date` matching the query parameter
- Must produce similar results when run multiple times
  - Should produce identical results when run multiple times
- May depend on the previous partition
  - If using previous partition, must include a `.init.sql` query to init the
    table
  - Should be impacted by values from a finite number of preceding partitions
    - This allows for backfilling in chunks instead of serially for all time
      and limiting backfills to a certain number of days following updated data
    - For example `sql/nondesktop_clients_last_seen_v1.sql` can be run serially
      on any 28 day period and the last day will be the same whether or not the
      partition preceding the first day was missing because values are only
      impacted by 27 preceding days
