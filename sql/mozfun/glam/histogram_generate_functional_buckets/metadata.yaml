  Generate functional buckets for a histogram. This is specific to Glean.

  See: https://github.com/mozilla/glean/blob/main/glean-core/src/histogram/functional.rs

  A functional bucketing algorithm. The bucket index of a given sample is
  determined with the following function:

  i = $$ \lfloor{n log_{\text{base}}{(x)}}\rfloor $$

  In other words, there are n buckets for each power of `base` magnitude.
