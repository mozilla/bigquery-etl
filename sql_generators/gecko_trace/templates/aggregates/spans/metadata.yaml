friendly_name: Gecko Trace Spans
description: |-
  Individual spans from Gecko traces across all Firefox applications.

  This view provides a unified interface to span data from multiple Firefox
  applications including Firefox Desktop, Firefox for Android (Fenix Nightly),
  and Firefox for Android (Beta). Each row represents a single span within
  a trace, with an additional application field to identify the source.

  Spans represent units of work or operations within Firefox, such as DOM
  parsing, network requests, JavaScript execution, or rendering operations.
  Each span includes timing information, hierarchical relationships, and
  contextual metadata for performance analysis and debugging.
