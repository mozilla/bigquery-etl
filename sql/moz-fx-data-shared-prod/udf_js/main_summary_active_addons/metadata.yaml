friendly_name: Main Summary Active Addons
description: |-
  Add fields from additional_attributes to active_addons in main pings.  Return an array instead of a "map" for backwards compatibility.  The INT64 columns from BigQuery may be passed as strings, so parseInt before returning them if they will be coerced to BOOL.  The fields from additional_attributes due to union types: integer or boolean for foreignInstall and userDisabled; string or number for version. https://github.com/mozilla/telemetry-batch-view/blob/ea0733c00df191501b39d2c4e2ece3fe703a0ef3/src/main/scala/com/mozilla/telemetry/views/MainSummaryView.scala#L422-L449
