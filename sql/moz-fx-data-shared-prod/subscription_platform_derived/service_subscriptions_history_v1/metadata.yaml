friendly_name: Service subscriptions history
description: |-
  History of changes to service subscriptions, which are a continuous active period for a specific service by a particular provider subscription.

  To get the historical state at a particular point in time use a condition like the following:
    valid_from <= {timestamp}
    AND valid_to > {timestamp}

  Some caveats:
    * We only have partial data for Stripe subscriptions prior to March 2023 due to a data loss incident (DENG-754).
