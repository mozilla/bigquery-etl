friendly_name: Migrated Clients
description: >
  Contains the Fennec Client ID and Fenix Client ID for any clients
  who have migrated from Fennec to Fenix. This is across all release
  channels. Every client will have at most one entry, and if a
  Fennec client is not present then it indicates that they have
  not migrated. Fennec Client ID, channel, and submission_date
  are taken from the _last_ value seen for that client.
