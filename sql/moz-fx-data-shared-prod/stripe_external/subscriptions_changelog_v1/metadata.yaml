friendly_name: Stripe subscriptions changelog
description: |-
  Changes to Stripe subscriptions as recorded by Fivetran (https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/stripe).

  IMPORTANT: This table should not be rebuilt without first verifying the integrity of the underlying Fivetran `subscription_history` data.
  Fivetran will delete and overwrite `subscription_history` data if a full resync of that table happens.
  A full resync of `subscription_history` did happen between 2023-02-24 and 2023-02-26 (DENG-754),
  so changes Fivetran recorded as being prior to 2023-02-27 may be inaccurate.

  This table's schema closely mirrors Stripe's subscriptions API (https://stripe.com/docs/api/subscriptions/object).
  Fields which Fivetran doesn't sync and fields specific to Stripe Connect have been omitted.
