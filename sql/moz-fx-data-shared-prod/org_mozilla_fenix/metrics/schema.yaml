        the immediate source of the loaded data: "dump" means packaged with the application,
        "remote" means a freshly downloaded bloomfilter, "cache" means a previously
        downloaded bloomfilter. "dump_fallback" and "cache_fallback" means that the
        last known bloomfilter was used, despite it not matching the latest record
        in the RemoteSettings collection. In this case the outdated bloomfilter is
        used as a fallback (e.g. because the latest version cannot be downloaded).
        "unknown"  means that the bloomfilter cannot be loaded at all. This can happen
        if the blocklist is disabled via preferences or enterprise policies.

      description: 'The distribution of search term tab group sizes. Rather than reporting

        individual sizes directly as integers, it is currently desired to

        report the sizes according to certain size ranges.

        The "buckets" for reporting group sizes will be mapped as follows:

        * 2 tabs -> 1

        * 3-5 tabs -> 2

        * 6-10 tabs -> 3

        * 11+ tabs -> 4

        Where the reported number will be 1, 2, 3, or 4, accordingly.

        As an example, say a user has three groups of sizes 3, 6, and 15. The

        app will report 2, 3, and 4 when this metric is tracked.

        it could potentially be happening. The second set is that in which the APZC

        transform it so as to display checkerboarding to the user. Combined with other
