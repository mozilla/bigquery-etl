description: Identical to bits28_days_since_seen.  Returns a 0-based index
  of the rightmost set bit in the passed bit pattern or null if no bits are
  set (bits = 0).  To determine this position, we take a bitwise AND of the
  bit pattern and its complement, then we determine the position of the bit
  via base-2 logarithm; see https://stackoverflow.com/a/42747608/1260237
