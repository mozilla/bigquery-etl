    Prevent overflows by only keeping buckets where value is less than 2^40
    allowing 2^24 entries. This value was chosen somewhat abitrarily, typically
    the max histogram value is somewhere on the order of ~20 bits.
    Negative values are incorrect and should not happen but were observed,
    probably due to some bit flips.
