  Daily install statistics to power addons.mozilla.org stats pages. See bug 1654330. Note that this table uses a hashed_addon_id defined as `TO_HEX(SHA256(addon_id))` because the underlying event pings have limitations on length of properties attached to events and addon_id values are sometimes too long. The AMO stats application looks up records in this table based on the hashed_addon_id.
  The hashed_addon_id is only valid for install_stats: https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/5b061cdc4d40d44988dc61aa941cfbd98e31791f/toolkit/components/telemetry/Events.yaml#233-234
