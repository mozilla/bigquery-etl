friendly_name: Safe CRC-32 Uuid
description: |-
  Calculate the CRC-32 hash of a 36-byte UUID, or NULL if the value isn't 36 bytes.  This implementation is limited to an exact length because recursion does not work. Based on https://stackoverflow.com/a/18639999/1260237 See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check
