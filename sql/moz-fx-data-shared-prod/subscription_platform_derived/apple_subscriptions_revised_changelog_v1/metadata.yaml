friendly_name: Apple subscriptions revised changelog
description: |-
  Changes to Apple subscriptions as recorded by SubPlat in Firestore, with revisions to improve historical accuracy.

  This table's schema roughly mirrors the Apple App Store Server subscriptions API
  (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreserverapi/get-all-subscription-statuses),
  though SubPlat doesn't currently save all the API fields and has added some custom metadata.
