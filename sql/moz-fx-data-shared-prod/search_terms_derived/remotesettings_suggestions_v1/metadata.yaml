friendly_name: Remote Settings Suggestions
description: >
  A table containing the suggestions imported from Remote Settings,
  from the same list powering Firefox Suggest.

  Populated by the `quicksuggest2bq` scheduled task in telemetry-airflow.

  Note that this table is non-sensitive and accessible to all Mozilla.
  It is located in a restricted dataset only because it is conceptually related
  to search terms data and used as input in search terms sanitization processes.
