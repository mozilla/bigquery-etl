description: Coalesce previous data's PCD with the new data's PCD.
  We generally want to believe only the first reasonable profile
  creation date that we receive from a client. Given bytes representing
  usage from the previous day and the current day, this function shifts
  the first argument by one day and returns either that value if non-zero
  and non-null, the current day value if non-zero and non-null, or else
  0.
