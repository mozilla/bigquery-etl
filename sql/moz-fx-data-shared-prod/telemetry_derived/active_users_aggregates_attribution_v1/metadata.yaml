friendly_name: Active Users Aggregates Attribution
description: |-
  This aggregation contains the metrics of daily, weekly and monthly
  active users as well as new profiles and search counts in the
  context of analysing where the installations come from and
  the cohorts behaviour. This information is retrieved by the
  attribution parameters and complemented with the core
  dimensions: country, submission_date, app_name and whether the
  browser is set to default or not.

  The reason to have this aggregate in addition to active_users_aggregates
  is to improve the query performance for final users, by separating the
  analysis of the numerous attribution parameters, which is required with
  less regularity than other dimensions and mostly for specific purposes
  E.g. During investigations or marketing campaigns.
