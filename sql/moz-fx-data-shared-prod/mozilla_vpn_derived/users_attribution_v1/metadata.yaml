friendly_name: Mozilla VPN users attribution archive
description: |-
  Archive of early VPN users' attribution data before the VPN ETL was changed to pull attribution from FxA events (DVPN-47).

  The attribution data was originally stored in the Guardian database's `users` table and synced into `mozilla_vpn_external.users_v1`.
  It was later copied into `mozilla_vpn_derived.fxa_attribution_v1` after that table was created in PR 2288.
  Now it's archived here to clearly distinguish it from the FxA events-based attribution data.
