description: >
  One row per user per service per day, showing metrics across services.

  The `user_id` and `client_id` are directly related to the
  `ecosystem_user_id` and `ecosystem_client_id` primitive
  identifiers for Account Ecosystem Telemetry, but are abstracted
  to prevent fingerprinting and to provide continuity across
  user password reset events. In this view, we are guaranteed that
  a logical user is represented by a consistent `user_id` over time.

  For rows representing client telemetry, this view looks up `user_id`
  at runtime based on `client_id` so that we can have `user_id` values
  present for any client that has ever logged in to FxA, even for older
  rows before the first login.
