friendly_name: Stripe subscriptions revised changelog
description: |-
  Changes to Stripe subscriptions as recorded by Fivetran, with revisions to improve historical accuracy.

  Between 2023-02-24 and 2023-02-26 Fivetran did a full resync of the `subscription_history` table,
  overwriting/deleting existing history records for most subscriptions and replacing them with a
  single history record per subscription purporting to be in effect from the start of the subscription,
  but actually reflecting the current state of the subscription at the time it was resynced (DENG-754).
  As a result, we've had to adjust and synthesize records to more accurately reconstruct history.

  This table's schema closely mirrors Stripe's subscriptions API (https://stripe.com/docs/api/subscriptions/object).
  Fields which Fivetran doesn't sync and fields specific to Stripe Connect have been omitted.
