friendly_name: Recent monthly active logical subscriptions
description: |-
  Monthly snapshots of logical subscriptions that were active at any point during the previous 7 days.
  The latest state of the subscription during the month is saved.

  Logical subscriptions are a continuous active period for a particular provider subscription.

  Some caveats:
    * This data is considered to still be in flux due to possible late-arriving data.
    * We only have partial data for Stripe subscriptions prior to March 2023 due to a data loss incident (DENG-754).
