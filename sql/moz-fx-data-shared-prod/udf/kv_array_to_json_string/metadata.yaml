description: Returns a JSON string representing the input key-value array.
  Value type must be able to be represented as a string - this function will
  cast to a string. At Mozilla, the schema for a map is
  STRUCT<key_value ARRAY<STRUCT<key ANY TYPE, value ANY TYPE>>>.
  To use this with that representation, it should be as
  `udf.kv_array_to_json_string(struct.key_value)`.
