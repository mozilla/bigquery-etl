friendly_name: Monthly active logical subscriptions
description: |-
  Monthly snapshots of logical subscriptions that were active at any point during each month.
  The latest state of the subscription during the month is saved.

  Logical subscriptions are a continuous active period for a particular provider subscription.

  Some caveats:
    * We only have partial data for Stripe subscriptions prior to March 2023 due to a data loss incident (DENG-754).
    * We only have partial data for Apple subscriptions prior to December 2022 when VPN's Apple subscriptions were migrated to SubPlat (VPN-3921).
