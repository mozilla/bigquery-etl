friendly_name: Crashes Daily
description: |-
  One row per-client, per-day, for those who crashed on that day.
  Includes a bit of helpful information for analysis, like
  os, os_version, channel, and country; however this data
  will be most useful when joined with clients_daily.
  Clustered on channel and os, since these are common
  query dimensions.
