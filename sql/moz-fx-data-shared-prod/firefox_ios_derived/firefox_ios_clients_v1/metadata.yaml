friendly_name: Firefox Clients (iOS)
description: |-
  First observations for Firefox iOS clients,
  retrieved from the earliest pings: baseline, first_session and metrics.
  The attributes stored in this table include the first attribution,
  device, OS and ISP details.

  This table should be accessed through the user-facing view
  `firefox_ios.firefox_ios_clients`.

  For analysis purposes, use first_seen_date to query clients that
  effectively appeared on that date.

  Note that the query for this table overwrites the whole table instead of writing to
  a single partition.

  Proposal:
  https://docs.google.com/document/d/12bj4DhCybelqHVgOVq8KJlzgtbbUw3f68palNrv-gaM/.
