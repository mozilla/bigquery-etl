friendly_name: FxA Server Events (prod)
description: |
  FxA server events extracted from accounts server stdout logs.
  This new table is the direct result of FxA migration from AWS to GCP
  (see: OPST-296 for more context).
  Effective x (TODO: add a date here prior to merging) date the events from the following servers will land in this table:
  - auth    (previous table: `fxa_auth_events_v1`)
  - content (previous table: `fxa_content_events_v1`)
  Payment server events will continue landing inside: `fxa_stdout_events_v1`

  # cannot set clustering via this config file as no schema.yaml
  # file due to how volatile the table schema can be.
  # To mitigate this we create the table using the init.sql file
  # which creates an empty table with the following fields and configuration:
  # - timestamp TIMESTAMP - partition field
  # - fxa_log STRING - cluster field
  # the argument ALLOW_FIELD_ADDITION takes care of adding all the missing field
  # as part of the ETL execution.
