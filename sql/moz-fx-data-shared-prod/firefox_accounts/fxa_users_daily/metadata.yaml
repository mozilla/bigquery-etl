description: 'Derived from fxa_users_services (user/service level) and aggregated

  to the user level. If the user had multiple different entries on a single day,

  then we grab the attributes from the first service observed that day.

  This includes information about which users were active on a specific day

  along with some attributes related to that user.

  See the schema for a list of attributes and their descriptions.


  This lower level model uses the following category of events:

  event_category IN (''auth'', ''auth_bounce'', ''content'', ''oauth'')


  Partitioned by submission_date,
