  A daily joining of Firefix download tokens with Google Analytics attribution data.

  1. Each row in this table should be a unique dltoken.

  2. A single GA session can have multiple dltokens (a session resulted in multiple downloads).

  3. If the stub_visit_id is '', '(not set)', or 'something', the exception column will be:
    * DOWNLOAD_SESSION_ID_EMPTY
    * DOWNLOAD_SESSION_ID_VALUE_NOT_SET or
    * DOWNLOAD_SESSION_ID_VALUE_SOMETHING
    * All GA derived values will be null

  4. If the stub_visit_id is valid but not found in that day's GA sessions:
    * exception column will be MISSING_GA_CLIENT
    * All GA derived values will be null

  5. A GA session which does not have a dltoken with a corresponding stub_visit_id/clientId match is excluded from this dataset.

  6. The stub_visit_id has a clientId match but that clientId has multiple GA sessions that day:
    * exception value will be GA_UNRESOLVABLE
    * All GA derived values will be null

  7. A single dltoken has multiple records
    * count_dltoken_duplicates will be >= 1.
    * A value of 0 means there are no duplicates (expected state).
    * A value of 1 means there was 1 other row with the dltoken value, etc.
