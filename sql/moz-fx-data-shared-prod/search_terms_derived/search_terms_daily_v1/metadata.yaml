friendly_name: Search Terms Daily
description: |-
  Daily count of terminal search terms collected by Merino.

  Note: This table processes data from 2 days ago, allowing time for the
  upstream Merino sanitization job (~16 hours) to complete.
  This is a temporary measure until the sanitization job is further optimized.
