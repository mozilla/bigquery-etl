friendly_name: Bits To Days Since Seen
description: |-
  Given a BYTES, return the number of days since the client was last seen.  If no bits are set, returns NULL, indicating we don't know. Otherwise the results are 0-indexed, meaning \x01 will return 0.  Tests showed this being 5-10x faster than the simpler alternative: CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION   udf.bits_to_days_since_seen(b BYTES) AS ((     SELECT MIN(n)     FROM UNNEST(GENERATE_ARRAY(0, 364)) AS n     WHERE BIT_COUNT(SUBSTR(b >> n, -1) & b'\x01') > 0)); See also: bits_to_days_since_first_seen.sql
