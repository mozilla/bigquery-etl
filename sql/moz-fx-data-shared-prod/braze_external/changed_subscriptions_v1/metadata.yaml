friendly_name: Braze Changed Subscriptions Sync | Firefox Workspace
description: |-
  Changes in subscriptions in Braze from the previous day - mapped to the Firefox workspace.
  In order to consume the least amount of data points, we only want to sync rows changed
  since the last sync. This table holds all of the changed subscription data that syncs to braze.
