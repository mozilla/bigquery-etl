friendly_name: Rolling Cohorts
description: |-
  Rolling Cohorts consists of one row per client per date (each date
  representing a new cohort) i.e. all the clients that had their first
  ping sent that day. This can be left joined with various activity
  tables to calculate activity metrics for particular cohorts.

  Note that client-attributes such as os versions, is default browser,
  etc. are based on the values at the time the cohort is created.
  This might not be the same as when activity happens. For example
  if a client changes whether Firefox is the default browser.
