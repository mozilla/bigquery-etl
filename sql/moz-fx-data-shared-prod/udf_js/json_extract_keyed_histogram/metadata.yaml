description: Returns an array of parsed structs from a JSON string representing
 a keyed histogram.  This is likely only useful for histograms that weren't
  properly parsed to fields, so ended up embedded in an additional_properties
  JSON blob. Normally, keyed histograms will be modeled as a key/value struct
  where the values are JSON representations of single histograms. There is no
  pure SQL equivalent to this function, since BigQuery does not provide any
  functions for listing or iterating over keysn in a JSON map.
