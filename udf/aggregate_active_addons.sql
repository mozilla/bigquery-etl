This function selects most frequently occuring value for each addon_id, using
the latest value in the input among ties. The type for active_addons is
ARRAY<STRUCT<addon_id STRING, ...>>, i.e. the output of
`SELECT ARRAY_CONCAT_AGG(active_addons) FROM telemetry.main_summary_v4`, and
is left unspecified to allow changes to the fields of the STRUCT.
