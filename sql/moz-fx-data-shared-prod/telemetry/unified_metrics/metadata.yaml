friendly_name: Unified Metrics
description: |-
  Unified view on common browser metrics across all products.

  Note. The app name uses the suffix ` Glean` to differentiate
  data from Legacy and Glean during the migration to use only
  Glean. For this reason is important to query this table always
  using the view, which retrieves the correct dataset.
