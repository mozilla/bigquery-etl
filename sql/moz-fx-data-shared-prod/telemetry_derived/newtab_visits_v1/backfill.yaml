  reason:
    We discovered a missing field in `newtab_visits_v1`. Added it in https://github.com/mozilla/bigquery-etl/pull/5345.
    Now we need to backfill for its entire history so we can use this field downstream.

  reason:
    The previous backfill needs to be extended to cover the full history of visits
    to fill in the two new fields. The PR that added these fields merged on
    '2024-03-18' (https://github.com/mozilla/bigquery-etl/pull/5224#event-12159631760),
    and `newtab_visits` has the new fields populated on that date

    This is mostly a test backfill, this table will replace newtab_interactions_v1
    eventually
