friendly_name: Logical subscriptions events
description: |-
  Logical subscription events such as "Subscription Start", "Plan Change", "Auto-Renew Change", and "Subscription End".

  Logical subscriptions are a continuous active period for a particular provider subscription.

  Some caveats:
    * This ETL is delayed by 7 extra days to allow more time for possible late-arriving data.
      More recent data that is still in flux can be found in `recent_logical_subscription_events_v1`.
    * We only have partial data for Stripe subscriptions prior to March 2023 due to a data loss incident (DENG-754).
    * We only have partial data for Apple subscriptions prior to December 2022 when VPN's Apple subscriptions were migrated to SubPlat (VPN-3921).
