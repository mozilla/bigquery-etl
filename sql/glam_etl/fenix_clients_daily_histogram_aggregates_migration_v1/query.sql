-- ARRAY_CONCAT_AGG may fail if the array of records exceeds 20 MB when
-- serialized and shuffled. This may exhibit itself in a pathological case where
-- the a single client sends *many* pings in a single day. However, this case
-- has not been observed. If this does occur, each histogram should be unnested
-- aggregated. This will force more shuffles and is inefficient. This may be
-- mitigated by removing all of the empty entries which are sent to keep bucket
-- ranges contiguous.
