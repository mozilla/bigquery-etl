description: |-
  Subscription service attribution impressions from SubPlat logs.

  Some caveats:
    * This ETL is delayed by an extra day to allow more time for possible late-arriving data.
      More recent data that is still in flux can be found in `recent_subplat_attribution_impressions_v1`.

  # Adjust the execution delta for the task dependencies in the bqetl_subplat_hourly DAG:
  #   * -23h for upstream ETLs which overwrite the entire table, to wait for the hourly ETL that
  #     started at the same time as this daily ETL, so the upstream table is in a consistent state.
  #   * 2h for upstream ETLs which write to a specific date partition, to wait for the last hourly
  #     ETL that will have written to the date partition this daily ETL will be reading from,
  #     taking into consideration the date_partition_offset.
