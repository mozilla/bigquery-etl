friendly_name: Italy's mid-pandemic internet outage (May 2020)
# yamllint disable rule:line-length
description: |-
  The released data includes aggregated Firefox Desktop data for Italy
  from “health” and some fields of the “main” pings that were created
  between January 1st, 2020 up until March 31st, 2020. The different types
  of failures are aggregated by day. These counts are then normalized by
  the total number of active daily users: this gives an indication of how
  broadly a network problem is affecting a bigger percentage of Firefox
  Desktop clients.

  The dataset contains the following fields:
    - `date`: the date the data was recorded by the Firefox client.
    - `proportion_undefined`: the proportion of users who failed
    to send telemetry for a reason that was not listed in the other cases.
    - `proportion_timeout`: the proportion of users that had their
    connection timeout while uploading telemetry
    ([after 90s, in Firefox](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/fa2df28a49883612bd7af4dacd80cdfedcccd2f6/toolkit/components/telemetry/app/TelemetrySend.jsm#81)).
    - `proportion_abort`: the proportion of users that had their connection
    terminated by the client (for example, terminating open connections
    before shutting down).
    - `proportion_unreachable`: the proportion of users that failed to upload
    telemetry because the server was not reachable (e.g. because the host was
    not reachable, proxy problems or OS waking up after a suspension).
    - `proportion_terminated`: the proportion of users that had their
    connection terminated internally by the networking code.
    - `proportion_channel_open`: the proportion of users for which the upload
    request was terminated immediately, by the client, because of a Necko
    internal error.
    - `avg_dns_success_time`: the average time it takes for a successful DNS
    resolution, in milliseconds.
    - `avg_dns_failure_time`: the average time it takes for an unsuccessful DNS
    resolution, in milliseconds.
    - `count_dns_failure`: the average count of unsuccessful DNS resolutions
    reported.
    - `avg_tls_handshake_time`: the average time after the TCP SYN to ready
    for HTTP, in milliseconds.

  Caveats with the data:
  As with any observational data, there are many caveats and interpretation must
  be done carefully. Below is a list of issues we have considered, but it is
  not exhaustive.
    - Firefox users are not representative of the general population in their
    region.
    - Users can experience multiple types of failures and so the proportions are
    not summable. For example, if 2.4% of clients had a timeout and 2.6% of
    clients had eUnreachable that doesn't necessarily mean that 5.0% of clients
    had a timeout or a eUnreachable
    - Geographical data is based on IPGeo databases. These databases are
    imperfect, so some activity may be attributed to the wrong location.
    Further, proxy and VPN usage can create geo-attribution errors.
