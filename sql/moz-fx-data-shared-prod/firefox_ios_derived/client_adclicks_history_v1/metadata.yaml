friendly_name: Client Adclicks History
description: |-
  Contains the full history of ad-clicks for each client.

  This should only be used for the LTV project.
  To calculate LTV for any client, we add together two things -
  1. Predicted future Ad Clicks
  2. Total historical ad clicks

  This table provides 2.
  The full history of each client's ad_clicks
  are available as a MAP, keyed by date,
  where the value is the number of ad clicks.
