friendly_name: Normalize Subscription Months Renewed
description: >
  Take subscription start and end and determine the number of months for which
  the subscription has been renewed. Values must be datetime in the correct time
  zone, because the definition of month is timezone sensitive. For example, a
  subscription from 2021-01-01 to 2021-03-01 was renewed 1 time. Also don't
  count subscriptions as renewed if it end during the billing grace period,
  usually 2 days. For example, a subscription from 2021-01-01 to 2021-03-03 was
  renewed one time because it ended during the grace period, but if it ended on
  2021-03-04 then it was renewed twice
