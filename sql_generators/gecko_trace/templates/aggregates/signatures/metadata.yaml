friendly_name: Gecko Trace Signatures
description: |-
  Signature-based trace statistics from Gecko across all Firefox applications.

  This view provides a unified interface to signature data from multiple Firefox
  applications including Firefox Desktop, Firefox for Android (Fenix Nightly),
  and Firefox for Android (Beta). Each row represents aggregated statistics
  for a specific trace signature pattern, with an additional application field
  to identify the source.

  Signatures are calculated based on the hierarchical structure and attributes
  of spans within traces, allowing identification of common execution patterns.
  This enables performance analysis, anomaly detection, and comparison of
  execution patterns across different Firefox applications. The average duration
  and hit count metrics help identify performance regressions and optimization
  opportunities.
