friendly_name: {{ app_value }} Active Users Aggregates
description: |-
  This table contains daily/weekly/montly active users,
  new profiles, searches and ad_clicks for {{ app_value }},
  aggregated by submission_date, attribution, channel,
  country, city, device model, distribution_id, os details
  and activity segment.

  For Firefox Desktop, qualified daily active users QDAU
  are calculated. For mobile apps QDAU = DAU.

  The table is labeled as "change_controlled", which implies
  that changes require the approval of at least one owner.
