friendly_name: Clients Last Seen Joined
description: |-
  Join on baseline and metrics views, but uses a LEFT JOIN
  such that a given client will not appear in the result if
  it is only represented in the metrics-based table.

  NOTE:
  In rare cases the union can result in the same client_id entry from different channels.
  In such cases, the resulting data will only include the entry for the client_id
  with the oldest first_seen_date value.
