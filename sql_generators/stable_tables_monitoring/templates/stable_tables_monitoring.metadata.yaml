  There are two main namespaces in BigQuery for used during telemetry ingestion process.
  Those namespaces end with _live and _stable . _live is the initial landing zone in BigQuery for our ping data
  coming from our ingestion-sink which uses a smaller time window to batch telemetry data together.
  However, there is a potential for duplicate entries in this dataset which is why once a day copy_deduplicate DAG performs de-duplication of this data
  and saves the result in the corresponding _stable namespace (which also acts as long term storage of this raw data).
  These BigEye checks add freshness and volume checks to these stable tables.
