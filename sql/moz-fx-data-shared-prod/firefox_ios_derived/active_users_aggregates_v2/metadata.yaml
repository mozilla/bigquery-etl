friendly_name: Firefox iOS Active Users Aggregates v2 | DEPRECATED due to a newer version available.
description: |-
  This table contains daily/weekly/monthly active users,
  new profiles, searches and ad_clicks for Firefox iOS,
  aggregated by submission_date, attribution, channel,
  country, city, device model, distribution_id, os details
  and activity segment.

  - dau is counting the users who reported a ping on the date and
  are qualified as active users.
  - daily_users counts all the users who reported a ping on the date.
  Only dau is exposed in the view telemetry.active_users_aggregates.

  The table is labeled as "change_controlled", which implies
  that changes require the approval of at least one owner.
