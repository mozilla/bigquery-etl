friendly_name: Jackknife Mean Ci
description: |-
  Calculates a confidence interval using a jackknife resampling technique for the mean of an array of values for various buckets; see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackknife_resampling  Users must specify the number of expected buckets as the first parameter to guard against the case where empty buckets lead to an array with missing elements.  Usage generally involves first calculating an aggregate per bucket, then aggregating over buckets, passing ARRAY_AGG(metric) to this function.
