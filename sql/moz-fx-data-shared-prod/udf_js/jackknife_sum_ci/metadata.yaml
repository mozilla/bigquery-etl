friendly_name: Jackknife Sum Ci
description: |-
  Calculates a confidence interval using a jackknife resampling technique for the sum of an array of counts for various buckets; see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackknife_resampling  Users must specify the number of expected buckets as the first parameter to guard against the case where empty buckets lead to an array with missing elements.  Usage generally involves first calculating an aggregate count per bucket, then aggregating over buckets, passing ARRAY_AGG(metric) to this function.  Example:  WITH bucketed AS (   SELECT     submission_date,     SUM(dau) AS dau_sum   FROM     mytable GROUP BY     submission_date,     bucket_id ) SELECT   submission_date, udf_js.jackknife_sum_ci(ARRAY_AGG(dau_sum)).* FROM   bucketed GROUP BY   submission_date
