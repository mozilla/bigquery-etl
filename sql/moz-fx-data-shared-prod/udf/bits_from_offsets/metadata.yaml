friendly_name: Bits From Offsets
description: |
  Returns a bit pattern of type BYTES compactly encoding the given array of positive integer offsets.
  This is primarily useful to generate a compact encoding of dates on which a feature was used, with arbitrarily long history. Example aggregation:
  ```sql bits_from_offsets(
    ARRAY_AGG(IF(foo, DATE_DIFF(anchor_date, submission_date, DAY), NULL)
              IGNORE NULLS)
  ) ```
  The resulting value can be cast to an INT64 representing the most recent 64 days via:
  ```sql CAST(CONCAT('0x', TO_HEX(RIGHT(bits >> i, 4))) AS INT64) ```
  Or representing the most recent 28 days (compatible with bits28 functions) via:
  ```sql CAST(CONCAT('0x', TO_HEX(RIGHT(bits >> i, 4))) AS INT64) << 36 >> 36 ```
