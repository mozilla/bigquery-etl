friendly_name: Clients First Seen
description: |-
  Identical in schema to `clients_daily` except that each client appears only
  once over all time; includes fields `first_seen_date` and `second_seen_date`
  for determining user "activation".

  Note that `first_seen_date` and `second_seen_date` are also pulled into
  `clients_last_seen` to avoid needing to join with this view. Use this view
  directly only when you're investigating client activation questions.

  Clustering fields: `normalized_channel`, `sample_id`

  See also: `clients_daily`, `clients_last_seen`
