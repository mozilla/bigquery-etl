friendly_name: Sponsored Tiles Clients Daily
description: |-
  daily client-level aggregates of Sponsored Tiles-related fields.
  Note that for desktop tile dismissals and disables, we deprecated PingCentre's Activity Stream in Fx123,
  and now rely on Glean's newtab ping as of Fx120. There's an effective cutover version of Fx123.
