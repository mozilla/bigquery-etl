friendly_name: Firefox Clients (iOS) - Retention (first 28 days)
description: |-
  The table aims to provide information about user's activity
  and their retention during their first 28 days.

  Assumption is that we should only see each client once in the first_seen table
  so this table should only contain 1 entry per client.
