        * 2 tabs -> 1

        * 3-5 tabs -> 2

        * 6-10 tabs -> 3

        * 11+ tabs -> 4

        This is the union of two possibly-intersecting sets of time periods: The first

        it could potentially be happening. The second set is that in which the APZC
        is actively transforming content in the compositor, since it could potentially
        transform it so as to display checkerboarding to the user. Combined with other

        <br>- Not choosing to record a MAIN based on what the user would see and

        preparation is usually fast since no additional I/O is required. If an error

        metrics to distinguish between different types of datastore preparations (e.g.,

        "persistent", "temporary" or "default" (there''s also "private" repository
        but that should never be iterated by the function). The main purpose is to
        track and analyze iteration counts during the initialization process of each
        repository type, helping to identify performance trends or potential inefficiencies
        across these repositories. This can provide insight into the impacts of specific
        code changes, including potential optimizations or regressions.
