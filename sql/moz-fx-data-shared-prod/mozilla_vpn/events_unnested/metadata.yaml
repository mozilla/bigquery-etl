friendly_name: Events unnested view for Mozilla VPN
description: |-
  This is a view that automatically unnests the events data sent
  by Mozilla VPN's "main" ping. Ordinarily this table is automatically
  generated by glean_usage, but that currently assumes that events are
  sent in an "events" ping.
