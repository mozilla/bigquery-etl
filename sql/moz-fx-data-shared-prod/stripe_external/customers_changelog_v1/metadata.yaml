friendly_name: Stripe customers changelog
description: |-
  Changes to Stripe customers as recorded by Fivetran (https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/stripe).

  IMPORTANT: This table should not be rebuilt from scratch because the underlying Fivetran table doesn't preserve historical changes.
  This table is only truly accurate from the most recent full rebuild from scratch (2023-07-10) going forward.

  This table's schema closely mirrors Stripe's customers API (https://stripe.com/docs/api/customers/object).
  Fields which Fivetran doesn't sync and fields we've specifically chosen not to sync (e.g. PII) have been omitted.
