friendly_name: Sanitized Firefox Suggest Impressions with Search Terms
description: |-
  A sanitized historical view of pings sent for the
  `contextual-services/quicksuggest-impression`
  document type, including search terms fields.

  Note that `quicksuggest-impression` pings with search terms excluded
  are presented separately under the `contextual_services` dataset.

  This view is guaranteed to contain only complete days
  (per `submission_timestamp`)
  and to contain only one row per distinct `document_id` within a given date.

  Clustering fields: `normalized_channel`, `sample_id`
