  Return the number of recorded observations greater than threshold for
  the histogram.  CAUTION: Does not count any buckets that have any values
  less than the threshold. For example, a bucket with range (1, 10) will
  not be counted for a threshold of 2. Use threshold that are not bucket
  boundaries with caution.
