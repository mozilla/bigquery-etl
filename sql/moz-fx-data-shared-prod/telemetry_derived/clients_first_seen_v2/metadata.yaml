friendly_name: Clients First Seen
description: |-
  Picks out just the first observations per client based on
  the main, new_profile and first_shutdown pings.
  - All attributes are retrieved from the ping that reports
  the first_seen_date, using the earliest timestamp and respecting nulls.
  - In the case of different ping types received in the same timestamp,
  new_profile ping is prioritized.
  - Only the second_seen_date and client's reported pings are updated
  daily when NULL.
  This table should be accessed through the user-facing view
  `telemetry.clients_first_seen`.
  See caveats for analysis and how to use this table:

  The initialization command creates the table and then inserts data
  in parallel for each sample_id. Usage:
