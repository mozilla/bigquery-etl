friendly_name: Kv Array To Json String
description: |-
  Returns a JSON string representing the input key-value array. Value type must be able to be represented as a string - this function will cast to a string. At Mozilla, the schema for a map is STRUCT<key_value ARRAY<STRUCT<key ANY TYPE, value ANY TYPE>>>. To use this with that representation, it should be as `udf.kv_array_to_json_string(struct.key_value)`.
