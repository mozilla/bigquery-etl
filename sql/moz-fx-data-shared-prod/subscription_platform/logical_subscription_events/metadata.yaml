friendly_name: Logical subscriptions events
description: |-
  Logical subscription events such as "Subscription Start", "Plan Change", "Auto-Renew Change", and "Subscription End".

  Logical subscriptions are a continuous active period for a particular provider subscription.

  Some caveats:
    * Data for the past 7 days is considered to still be in flux due to possible late-arriving data.
    * We only have partial data for Stripe subscriptions prior to March 2023 due to a data loss incident (DENG-754).
