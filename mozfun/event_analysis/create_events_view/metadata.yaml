  Create a view that queries the events_daily table.
  This view currently supports funnels and event counts.

  Funnels are separated into steps, where every user did or did not
  complete that funnel step on that day.

  Event counts give the count per-user per-day.

  [Here](https://sql.telemetry.mozilla.org/queries/74809/source) is
  an example of using this procedure to create a view that gives
  information on collections usage in Fenix.
