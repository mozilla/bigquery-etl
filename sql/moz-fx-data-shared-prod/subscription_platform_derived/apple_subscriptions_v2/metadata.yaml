friendly_name: Apple subscriptions
description: |-
  Apple subscriptions as recorded by SubPlat in Firestore, with revisions to improve historical accuracy.

  This table's schema roughly mirrors the Apple App Store Server subscriptions API
  (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreserverapi/get-all-subscription-statuses),
  though SubPlat doesn't currently save all the API fields and has added some custom metadata.

  Some caveats:
    * We only have partial data for Apple subscriptions prior to December 2022 when VPN's Apple subscriptions were migrated to SubPlat (VPN-3921).
