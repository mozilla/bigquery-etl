friendly_name: Clients Last Seen
description: >
  Aggregations that show a rolling 28-day per-client summary on top of
  `clients_daily_*` tables.
  It also performs a join with `clients_first_seen_v1` in order to provide
  fields related to client activation that fall outside the 28-day window.
  It should normally be accessed through the user-facing view
  `telemetry.clients_last_seen`.
  Note that by end of Q1 2021, that view start referencing the downstream table
  `clients_last_seen_joined_v1` which merges in fields based on the `event`
  ping.
