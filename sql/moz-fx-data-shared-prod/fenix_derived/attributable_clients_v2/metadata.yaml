friendly_name: Attributable Clients v2
description: |
  For clients who
    - Sent a baseline ping
    - Sent a metrics ping
    - activated
  Records their information and associated activity.
  Note that while the grain is 1-row per-client per-day,
  a row does _not_ mean that said client was active on that day.
  Use the `active_day_count` field to determine that.
