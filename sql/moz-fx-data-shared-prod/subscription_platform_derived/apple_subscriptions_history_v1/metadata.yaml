friendly_name: Apple subscriptions history
description: |-
  History of changes to Apple subscriptions as recorded by SubPlat in Firestore, with revisions to improve historical accuracy.

  To get the historical state at a particular point in time use a condition like the following:
    valid_from <= {timestamp}
    AND valid_to > {timestamp}

  This table's schema roughly mirrors the Apple App Store Server subscriptions API
  (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreserverapi/get-all-subscription-statuses),
  though SubPlat doesn't currently save all the API fields and has added some custom metadata.

  Some caveats:
    * We only have partial data for Apple subscriptions prior to December 2022 when VPN's Apple subscriptions were migrated to SubPlat (VPN-3921).
