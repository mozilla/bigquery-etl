  Interpolate missing histogram buckets with empty buckets so it becomes a valid
  estimator for the dirichlet distribution.

  See: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ipy1oFIKDvHr3R6Ku0goRjS11R1ZH1z2gygOGkSdqUg

  To use this, you must first:
  Aggregate the histograms to the client level, to get a histogram {k1: p1,
  k2:p2, ..., kK: pN} where the p's are proportions(and p1, p2, ... sum to 1)
  and Kis the number of buckets.

  This is then the client's estimated density, and every client has been
  reduced to one row (i.e the client's histograms are reduced to this single
  one and normalized).

  Then add all of these across clients to get {k1: P1, k2:P2, ..., kK: PK}
  where P1 = sum(p1 across N clients) and P2 = sum(p2 across N clients).

  Calculate the total number of buckets K, as well as the total number of
  profiles `N reporting`

  Then our estimate for final density is:
  [{k1: ((P1 + 1/K) / (nreporting+1)), k2: ((P2 + 1/K) /(nreporting+1)), ... }
