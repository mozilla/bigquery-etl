friendly_name: Mozilla VPN users attribution archive
description: |-
  Archive of VPN users' attribution data between 2020-06-25 and 2022-03-23.

  The attribution data was originally stored in the Guardian database's `users` table and synced into `mozilla_vpn_external.users_v1`.
  It was later copied into the undocumented `mozilla_vpn_external.users_attribution_v1` table with the attribution data as JSON strings.
  Now it's officially archived here in a fully structured table.
