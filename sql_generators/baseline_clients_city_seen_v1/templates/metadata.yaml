friendly_name: Baseline Clients City Seen
description: |-
  This table stores the first-seen and last-seen geo attributes for each client_id.
  The table was initialized from stable tables (with ~2 years of retention),
  so the initial dates reflect the earliest/latest observations within that window.
  After initialization, the city fields in the stable tables are nullified and
  the one-time initialization code is no longer relevant.  The table is updated daily using live tables,
  updating last-seen fields for existing clients and adding new clients with first-seen geo attributes
  that do not yet exist in the table.
  This table should not be backfilled beyond 30 days which is the maximum retention of live tables.
