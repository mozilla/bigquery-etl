{#
   We use raw here b/c the first pass is rendered to create the checks.sql
   files, and the second pass is rendering of the checks themselves.
   Without/outside the {% raw %} the macros would be rendered for every
   check file when we create the checks file, when `bqetl generate active_users`
   is called.
   Inside the {% raw %} the checks get rendered when we _run_ the check,
   during `bqetl query backfill`.
   (you can also run them locally with `bqetl check run`).
