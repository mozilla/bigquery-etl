-- This table implements the Mobile activation metric defined in June 2022
-- Based on data from the first seven days since profile creation, we select
-- clients with at least three days of use (first open plus two) and who
-- perform a search on the later half of the week. As such, this table will
-- always lag new profiles by seven days and the CTEs are filtered for
-- corresponding periods.
-- Each entry in this table corresponds to a new_profile
