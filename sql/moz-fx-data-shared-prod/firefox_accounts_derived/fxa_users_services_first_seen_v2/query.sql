-- contains_qualified_fxa_activity_event
-- Expects an array of event_types and service name
-- Iterates and checks if an event_type, service combination
-- should be considered when determining if this is the first
-- time it has been observed.
-- Example usage:
-- contains_qualified_fxa_activity_event(['fxa_activity'], NULL),  # returns TRUE
-- contains_qualified_fxa_activity_event(['fxa_activity'], 'firefox-ios'),  # returns TRUE
-- contains_qualified_fxa_activity_event(['fxa_login - complete'], NULL),  # returns FALSE
-- contains_qualified_fxa_activity_event(['fxa_login - complete'], 'firefox-ios'),  # returns TRUE
