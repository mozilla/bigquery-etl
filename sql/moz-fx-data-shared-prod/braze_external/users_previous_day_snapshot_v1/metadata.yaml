friendly_name: Braze User Profiles Previous Day Snapshot
description: |-
  This is a snapshot of the users table at the state it was in before
  the most recent DAG run. Since the user profiles table updates once a day at
  10AM UTC, we can update this snapshot looking 12 hours back (yesterday).

  This snapshot allows us to compare changed values in order to generate the
  JSON payloads for Braze's cloud data ingestion tool.
