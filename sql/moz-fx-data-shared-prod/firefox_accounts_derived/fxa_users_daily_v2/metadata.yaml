description: |
  Usage aggregations per FxA user per day. Build from fxa_users_services_daily.
  If the user had multiple different entries on a single day, then we grab
  the attributes from the first service observed that day.

  This lower level model uses the following category of events:
  event_category IN ('auth', 'auth_bounce', 'content', 'oauth')

  Partitioned by submission_date and clustered by country, os_name, and user_id
