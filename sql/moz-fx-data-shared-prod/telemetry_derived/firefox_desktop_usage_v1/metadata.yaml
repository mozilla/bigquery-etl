  Layer on top of `firefox_desktop_exact_mau28_v2` that adds the
  CDOU field, which is a windowed sum.

  Should normally be accessed through the user-facing view
  `telemetry.firefox_desktop_usage_2021`.

  This query can _almost_ be expressed as a single windowed sum over
  the base table, but has to deal with the edge case of very small
  slices in the underlying table. Very small slices may not show up
  every day, so we need to add extra logic to produce a dense that accounts
  for each slice consistently throughout the year, carrying over the accumulated
  CDOU for that slice even on days with no active clients.
