friendly_name: FxA Log Device Command Events
description: |-
  A subset of FxA auth server logs related to "send tab" activity.
  See https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1649074

  This table contains event data from the FxA service when it was still running in AWS.
  All new events come from GCP deployment of FxA and are available in the v2 of this table.
  The migration started on 2023-09-07 and was concluded by 2023-09-15.

#   This query references secret keys that are not available for dry runs,
#   so we must explicitly write out dependencies. In this case, the query
#   depends only on fxa logs produced via Stackdriver integration, so no other
#   scheduled tasks are involved and the referenced_tables list is empty.
