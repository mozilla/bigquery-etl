    The client_id according to Telemetry.
    Might not always have a value due to being too early for it to have loaded.

    the data upload pref is disabled (if Telemetry gets to go first), or between when a client_id
    has been removed and when it has been regenerated.
    Does not need to be sent in the Glean "deletion-request" ping.
