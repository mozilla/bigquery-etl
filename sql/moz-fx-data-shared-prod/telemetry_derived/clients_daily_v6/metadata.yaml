description: |-
  A daily aggregation over `main` pings from each Firefox
  desktop client, partitioned by day.

  It should normally be accessed through the user-facing view
  `telemetry.clients_daily`.
  Note that by end of Q1 2021, that view start referencing the downstream table
  `clients_last_seen_joined_v1` which merges in fields based on the `event`
  ping.
