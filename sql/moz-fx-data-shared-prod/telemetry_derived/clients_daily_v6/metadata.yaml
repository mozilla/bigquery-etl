friendly_name: Clients Daily
description: >-
  A daily aggregation over `main` pings from each Firefox
  desktop client, partitioned by day.

  Currently, `telemetry.clients_daily` is a view directly on top of this table,
  though by end of Q1 2021, it will transition to point at the downstream
  `clients_daily_joined_v1` which merges in fields based on the `event` ping.
