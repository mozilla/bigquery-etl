friendly_name: Corpus Items Current V1
description: |-
  This table surfaces the most recent version of each corpus_item_id from the
  corpus_items_updated table. In effect, this view converts the fact table of transactional updates into a
  dimension model of the most current state. This will pick up updates to the publisher and title fields when
  updated.
