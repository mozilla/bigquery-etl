friendly_name: Firefox Desktop Retention Clients
description: |-
  Measures 28-day (week-4) retention for Firefox Desktop clients anchored on a cohort “metric date.”
  Metric date represents the cohort of clients who were either:
  A) New on the metric date (first_seen_date = metric_date), or
  B) Seen on the metric date (sent a baseline ping that day).
  Submission date represents the date 27 days after the metric date (end of the 28-day window), when week-4 retention is evaluated.
  Primary Key: Client ID + Metric Date
