friendly_name: Firefox Desktop Usage 2021
description: |-
  Stable source for 2021 KPI data on Firefox desktop usage, including
  cumulative days of use (`cdou`) and new profiles, broken out by dimensions.
  Contains data back to 2017 for year-over-year comparisons.

  New profile counts are determined using the `first_seen_date` approach
  where we consider a profile new on the day it first sends a `main` ping.

  Queries should generally be `SUM` of the `cdou`, `new_profiles`, `dau`,
  `wau`, or `mau` fields, grouped by any dimensions you want to compare
  or filtered to only your target population.

  Example query to see CDOU and new profiles over time for the Windows
  population:

  ```
  SELECT
    submission_date,
    os,
    SUM(cdou) AS cdou,
    SUM(new_profiles) AS new_profiles
  FROM mozdata.telemetry.firefox_desktop_usage_2021
  WHERE os = 'Windows'
  GROUP BY submission_date
  ORDER BY submission_date
  ```

  Note that some amount of the upstream data in `clients_last_seen` will be
  deleted over time in response to user-initiated deletion requests, but the
  aggregates in this view (which are no longer client-level) will remain stable.
  Expect to see slightly higher results from this table compared to queries on
  client-level tables. The underlying table was initially created on 2021-02-19.
