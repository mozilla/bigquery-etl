friendly_name: Days Since Created Profile As 28 Bits
description: |-
  Takes in a difference between submission date and profile creation date and returns a bit pattern representing the profile creation date IFF the profile date is the same as the submission date or no more than 6 days earlier. Analysis has shown that client-reported profile creation dates are much less reliable outside of this range and cannot be used as reliable indicators of new profile creation.
