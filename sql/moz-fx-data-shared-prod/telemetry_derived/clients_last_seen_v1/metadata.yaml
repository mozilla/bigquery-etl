friendly_name: Clients Last Seen
description: |
  Aggregations that show a rolling 28-day per-client summary on top of
  `clients_daily_*` tables. It also performs a join with `clients_first_seen_v1`
  in order to provide fields related to client activation that fall outside
  the 28-day window. It should normally be accessed through the user-facing
  view `telemetry.clients_last_seen`. Note that by end of Q1 2021, that view
  start referencing the downstream table `clients_last_seen_joined_v1`
  which merges in fields based on the `event` ping.
