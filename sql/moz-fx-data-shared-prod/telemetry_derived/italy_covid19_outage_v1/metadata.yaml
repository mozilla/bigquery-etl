friendly_name: Italy's mid-pandemic internet outage (May 2020)
description: "The released data includes aggregated Firefox Desktop data for Italy\n\
  from \u201Chealth\u201D and some fields of the \u201Cmain\u201D pings that were\
  \ created\nbetween January 1st, 2020 up until March 31st, 2020. The different types\n\
  of failures are aggregated by day. These counts are then normalized by\nthe total\
  \ number of active daily users: this gives an indication of how\nbroadly a network\
  \ problem is affecting a bigger percentage of Firefox\nDesktop clients.\n\nThe dataset\
  \ contains the following fields:\n  - `date`: the date the data was recorded by\
  \ the Firefox client.\n  - `proportion_undefined`: the proportion of users who failed\n\
  \  to send telemetry for a reason that was not listed in the other cases.\n  - `proportion_timeout`:\
  \ the proportion of users that had their\n  connection timeout while uploading telemetry\n\
  \  ([after 90s, in Firefox](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/fa2df28a49883612bd7af4dacd80cdfedcccd2f6/toolkit/components/telemetry/app/TelemetrySend.jsm#81)).\n\
  \  - `proportion_abort`: the proportion of users that had their connection\n  terminated\
  \ by the client (for example, terminating open connections\n  before shutting down).\n\
  \  - `proportion_unreachable`: the proportion of users that failed to upload\n \
  \ telemetry because the server was not reachable (e.g. because the host was\n  not\
  \ reachable, proxy problems or OS waking up after a suspension).\n  - `proportion_terminated`:\
  \ the proportion of users that had their\n  connection terminated internally by\
  \ the networking code.\n  - `proportion_channel_open`: the proportion of users for\
  \ which the upload\n  request was terminated immediately, by the client, because\
  \ of a Necko\n  internal error.\n  - `avg_dns_success_time`: the average time it\
  \ takes for a successful DNS\n  resolution, in milliseconds.\n  - `avg_dns_failure_time`:\
  \ the average time it takes for an unsuccessful DNS\n  resolution, in milliseconds.\n\
  \  - `count_dns_failure`: the average count of unsuccessful DNS resolutions\n  reported.\n\
  \  - `avg_tls_handshake_time`: the average time after the TCP SYN to ready\n  for\
  \ HTTP, in milliseconds.\n\nCaveats with the data:\nAs with any observational data,\
  \ there are many caveats and interpretation must\nbe done carefully. Below is a\
  \ list of issues we have considered, but it is\nnot exhaustive.\n  - Firefox users\
  \ are not representative of the general population in their\n  region.\n  - Users\
  \ can experience multiple types of failures and so the proportions are\n  not summable.\
  \ For example, if 2.4% of clients had a timeout and 2.6% of\n  clients had eUnreachable\
  \ that doesn't necessarily mean that 5.0% of clients\n  had a timeout or a eUnreachable\n\
  \  - Geographical data is based on IPGeo databases. These databases are\n  imperfect,\
  \ so some activity may be attributed to the wrong location.\n  Further, proxy and\
  \ VPN usage can create geo-attribution errors."
