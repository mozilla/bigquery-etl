friendly_name: Clients Last Seen
description: >
  Captures history of activity of each client in 28 day
  windows for each submission date.

  Generally, this is direct product of clients_daily and serves to make
  certain query patterns more efficient by eliminating the need for
  self-joins that would otherwise be needed to consider windows of activity.
  As an exception, it pulls in first_seen_date and second_seen_date over all
  time from clients_first_seen since first_seen_date is highly valuable for
  providing a stable definition of when a profile was created.
