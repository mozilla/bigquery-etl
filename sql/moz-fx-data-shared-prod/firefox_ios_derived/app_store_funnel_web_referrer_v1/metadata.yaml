friendly_name: Firefox iOS App Store Funnel
description: |
  Derived dataset for supporting (Apple) app store funnel analysis (iOS).

  Only mozilla.org web_referrer has campaigns linked to it.
  This allows us to combine the campaign and web_referrer datasets together.

  Running a full refresh each time as the source dataset is small and
  the data can be late arriving. This way we ensure that the resulting table contains
  the complete dataset.
