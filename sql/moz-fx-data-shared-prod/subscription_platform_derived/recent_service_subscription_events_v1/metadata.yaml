friendly_name: Recent service subscriptions events
description: |-
  Service subscription events such as "Subscription Start", "Plan Change", "Auto-Renew Change", and "Subscription End" during the previous 7 days.

  Service subscriptions are a continuous active period for a specific service by a particular provider subscription.

  Some caveats:
    * This data is considered to still be in flux due to possible late-arriving data.
    * We only have partial data for Stripe subscriptions prior to March 2023 due to a data loss incident (DENG-754).
    * We only have partial data for Apple subscriptions prior to December 2022 when VPN's Apple subscriptions were migrated to SubPlat (VPN-3921).
