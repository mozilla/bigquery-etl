friendly_name: Clients First Seen
description: |-
  First observations of Firefox Desktop clients based on the ping that reports
  first: main, new_profile or first_shutdown.
  Previously, this view reflected only clients based on main ping. From Q4 2023
  these three pings are used to determine first_seen_date, second_seen date and
  other attributes. See https://mozilla-hub.atlassian.net/browse/DS-2929.

  Note that `first_seen_date` and `second_seen_date` are also pulled into
  `clients_last_seen` to avoid needing to join with this view. Use this view
  directly only when you're investigating client activation questions.

  Clustering fields: `normalized_channel`, `sample_id`
