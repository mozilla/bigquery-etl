friendly_name: AMO Stats DAU
description: >
  Deprecated version of daily install statistics to power addons.mozilla.org stats pages. See bug 1572873.

  This query looks backward in time by two days in order to allow
  some delay in installs actually being reported, which means each
  submission_date partition actually reflects installs from two days
  prior. We adjust for this in the user-facing view on top of this
  table (telemetry.amo_stats_installs), where we replace
  `submission_date` with `install_date`.
