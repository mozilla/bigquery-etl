friendly_name: Combine Days Seen Maps
description: |-
  The "clients_last_seen" class of tables represent various types of client activity within a 28-day window as bit patterns. This function takes in two arrays of structs (aka maps) where each entry gives the bit pattern for days in which we saw a ping for a given user in a given key. We combine the bit patterns for the previous day and the current day, returning a single map. See `udf.combine_experiment_days` for a more specific example of this approach.
