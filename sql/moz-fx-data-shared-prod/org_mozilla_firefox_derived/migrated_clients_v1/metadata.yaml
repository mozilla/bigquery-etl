friendly_name: Migrated Clients
description: |
  Contains the Fennec Client ID and Fenix Client ID for any clients who
  have migrated from Fennec to Fenix. This is across all release channels.
  Every client will have at most one entry, and if a Fennec client is not
  present then it indicates that they have not migrated. Fennec Client ID,
  channel, and submission_date are taken from the _last_ value seen for that client.
