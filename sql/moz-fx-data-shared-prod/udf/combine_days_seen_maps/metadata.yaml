description: The "clients_last_seen" class of tables represent various
  types of client activity within a 28-day window as bit patterns.
  This function takes in two arrays of structs (aka maps) where each
  entry gives the bit pattern for days in which we saw a ping for a given
  user in a given key. We combine the bit patterns for the previous day
  and the current day, returning a single map. See `udf.combine_experiment_days`
  for a more specific example of this approach.
