  generally, get a list of nodes from a JSON blob. Array elements are
  indicated as [...].  param input: The JSON blob to explode param
  indicates_node: An array of strings. If a key's value is an object, and
  contains one of these values, that key is returned as a node. param
  known_nodes: An array of strings. If a key is in this array, it is
  returned as a node.  Notes: - Use indicates_node for things like
  histograms. For example ['histogram_type'] will ensure that each
  histogram will be returned as a missing node, rather than the subvalues
  within the histogram   (e.g. values, sum, etc.) - Use known_nodes if
  you're aware of a missing section, like
  ['simpleMeasurements']  See here for an example
