  Layer on top of `firefox_nondesktop_exact_mau28_v1` that adds the
  CDOU field, which is a windowed sum.

  Should normally be accessed through the user-facing view
  `telemetry.mobile_usage_2021`.

  See also `telemetry.firefox_desktop_usage_2021`.

  This query can _almost_ be expressed as a single windowed sum over
  the base table, but has to deal with the edge case of very small
  slices in the underlying table. Very small slices may not show up
  every day, so we need to add extra logic to produce a dense that accounts
  for each slice consistently throughout the year, carrying over the accumulated
  CDOU for that slice even on days with no active clients.

  # The source table is already small here, so we completely recreate this
  # every night. We could express this incrementally by taking CDOU from the
  # previous day and adding dau from the new day, but this would make each
  # query dependent on history. Recreating the table is simpler and more robust.
