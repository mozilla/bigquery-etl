friendly_name: Combine Adjacent Days 28 Bits
description: |-
  Combines two bit patterns. The first pattern represents activity over a 28-day period ending "yesterday". The second pattern represents activity as observed today (usually just 0 or 1). We shift the bits in the first pattern by one to set the new baseline as "today", then perform a bitwise OR of the two patterns.
