  Each row in this table represents a particular addon on a particular day
  and provides all the information needed to populate the various
  "Daily Users" plots for the AMO stats dashboard.

  NOTE: Includes only clients that reported major app_version older than 148.
        This table is partially based on legacy telemetry (desktop), new version is based only on Glean Addons ping: `addons_derived.amo_stats_dau_v1`
