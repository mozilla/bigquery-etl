    The client_id according to Telemetry. 
    Might not always have a value due to being too early for it to have loaded. 
    Value may be the canary client id `c0ffeec0-ffee-c0ff-eec0-ffeec0ffeec0` in pings near when 
    the data upload pref is disabled (if Telemetry gets to go first), or between when a client_id 
    has been removed and when it has been regenerated. 
    Does not need to be sent in the Glean "deletion-request" ping.
