description: Calculate the CRC-32 hash of an input string.  The implementation
  here could be optimized. In particular, it calculates a lookup table on every
  invocation which could be cached and reused. In practice, though, this
  implementation appears to be fast enough that further optimization is not
  yet warranted.  Based on https://stackoverflow.com/a/18639999/1260237
