friendly_name: CRC-32
description: |-
  Calculate the CRC-32 hash of an input string.  The implementation here could be optimized. In particular, it calculates a lookup table on every invocation which could be cached and reused. In practice, though, this implementation appears to be fast enough that further optimization is not yet warranted.
