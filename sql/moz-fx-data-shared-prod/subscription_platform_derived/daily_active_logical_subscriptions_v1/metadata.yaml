friendly_name: Daily active logical subscriptions
description: |-
  Daily snapshots of logical subscriptions that were active at any point during each day.
  The latest state of the subscription during the day is saved.

  This ETL is delayed by 7 extra days to allow more time for possible late-arriving data.
  More recent data that is still in flux can be found in `recent_daily_active_logical_subscriptions_v1`.

  Logical subscriptions are a continuous active period for a particular provider subscription.
