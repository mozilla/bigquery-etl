description: 'Given a BYTES, return the number of days since the
  client was first seen.  If no bits are set, returns NULL, indicating
  we don''t know. Otherwise the result is 0-indexed, meaning that for
  \x01, it will return 0.  Results showed this being between 5-10x faster
  than the simpler alternative: CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION
  udf.bits_to_days_since_first_seen(b
  BYTES) AS ((     SELECT MAX(n)     FROM UNNEST(GENERATE_ARRAY(
  0, 8 * BYTE_LENGTH(b)))
  AS n     WHERE BIT_COUNT(SUBSTR(b >> n, -1) & b''\x01'') > 0));
