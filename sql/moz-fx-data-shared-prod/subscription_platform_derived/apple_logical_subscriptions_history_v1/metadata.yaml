friendly_name: Apple logical subscriptions history
description: |-
  History of changes to Apple logical subscriptions, which are a continuous active period for a particular subscription.

  To get the historical state at a particular point in time use a condition like the following:
    valid_from <= {timestamp}
    AND valid_to > {timestamp}

  Some caveats:
    * We only have partial data for Apple subscriptions prior to December 2022 when VPN's Apple subscriptions were migrated to SubPlat (VPN-3921).
