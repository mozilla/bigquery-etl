friendly_name: Gecko Trace Spans
description: |-
  Individual spans extracted from Gecko traces in Firefox applications.

  This table contains flattened span data from Gecko trace telemetry, where each
  row represents a single span within a trace. Spans represent units of work or
  operations within Firefox, such as DOM parsing, network requests, JavaScript
  execution, or rendering operations.

  Each span includes timing information, hierarchical relationships (via parent_span_id),
  and contextual metadata through resource and scope fields.
