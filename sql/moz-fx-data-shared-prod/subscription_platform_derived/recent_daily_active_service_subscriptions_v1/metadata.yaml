friendly_name: Recent daily active service subscriptions
description: |-
  Daily snapshots of service subscriptions that were active at any point during the previous 7 days.
  The latest state of the subscription during the day is saved.

  This data is considered to still be in flux due to possible late-arriving data.

  Service subscriptions are a continuous active period for a specific service by a particular provider subscription.
