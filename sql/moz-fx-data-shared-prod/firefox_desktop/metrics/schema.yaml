        "persistent", "temporary" or "default" (there''s also "private" repository
        but that should never be iterated by the function). The main purpose is to
        track and analyze iteration counts during the initialization process of each
        repository type, helping to identify performance trends or potential inefficiencies
        across these repositories. This can provide insight into the impacts of specific
        code changes, including potential optimizations or regressions.
