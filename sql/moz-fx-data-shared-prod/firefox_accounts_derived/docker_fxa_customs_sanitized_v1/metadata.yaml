  Sanitized version of docker_fxa_customs from FxA (PII is hashed).

  This table contains FxA customs (sanitized) events up until the migration from AWS to GCP was concluded.
  There is a time window between 2023-09-07 and 2023-09-15 when we were receiving events from both deployments.
  As the migration as concluded, new data will land and be available via the v2 of this table.
