friendly_name: Clients Last Seen
description: >
  Aggregations that show a rolling 28-day per-client summary on top of
  `clients_daily_*` tables.

  It also performs a join with `clients_first_seen_v1` in order to provide
  fields related to client activation that fall outside the 28-day window.

  Currently, `telemetry.clients_last_seen` is a view directly on top of this table,
  though by end of Q1 2021, it will transition to point at the downstream
  `clients_last_seen_joined_v1` which merges in fields based on the `event` ping.
