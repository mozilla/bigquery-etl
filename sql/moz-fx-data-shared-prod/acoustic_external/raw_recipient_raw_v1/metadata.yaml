friendly_name: Raw Recipient (Acoustic data)

description: >
  Import Raw Recipient file exported from Acoustic (CSV data).
  This includes metrics around email performance (clicks, opens, etc).

  Each partition represents CSV data that was provided Acoustic
  for the date correponding to Airflow's execution date

  NOTE: raw_recipient_raw_[VERSION] -
  raw appears twice as the first "raw" is part of the original
  Acoustic object type/name, the second raw represents raw data
  as served by Acoustic.
