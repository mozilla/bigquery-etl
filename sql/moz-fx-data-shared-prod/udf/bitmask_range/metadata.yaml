friendly_name: Bitmask Range
description: |-
  Returns a bitmask that can be used to return a subset of an integer representing a bit array. The start_ordinal argument is an integer specifying the starting position of the slice, with start_ordinal = 1 indicating the first bit. The length argument is the number of bits to include in the mask.  The arguments were chosen to match the semantics of the SUBSTR function; see https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/functions-and-operators#substr
