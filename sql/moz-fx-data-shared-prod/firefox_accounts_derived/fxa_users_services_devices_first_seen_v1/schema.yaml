- mode: NULLABLE
  name: device_id
  type: STRING
  description: |
    This DOES NOT correspond to a physical device! Everytime a user logs out and back
    in will have a different value for device_id. This should be treated more like
    a session identified (in our case, session does not expire).
    There are two ways in which device_id field value gets populated/generated:
    1. If the current flow session does not have a device_id associated with it we set
    it to the device_id/deviceId value found inside urlParams object.
    2. If during the above process we find urlParams object to not have this attribute set,
    then we use uuid.v4() to generate a new unique value and assign it to deviceId flow session.
