friendly_name: Bits To Days Since First Seen
description: |-
  Given a BYTES, return the number of days since the client was first seen.  If no bits are set, returns NULL, indicating we don't know. Otherwise the result is 0-indexed, meaning that for \x01, it will return 0.  Results showed this being between 5-10x faster than the simpler alternative: CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION udf.bits_to_days_since_first_seen(b BYTES) AS ((     SELECT MAX(n)     FROM UNNEST(GENERATE_ARRAY( 0, 8 * BYTE_LENGTH(b))) AS n     WHERE BIT_COUNT(SUBSTR(b >> n, -1) & b'\x01') > 0)); See also: bits_to_days_since_seen.sql
