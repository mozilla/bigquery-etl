friendly_name: Main Nightly
description: |-
  A materialized subset of main pings intended as a performance
  optimization for exploratory queries. It contains only the most recent
  six months of data for the nightly channel of Firefox.

  Queries on this table are logically equivalent to queries on top of `main_v5`
  with a filter on `normalized_channel = 'nightly'`, but this table has a few
  advantages.
  First, query estimates will be much more accurate; estimates of bytes scanned
  can't take into account clustering, so we sometimes see valid queries get
  rejected by Redash due to appearing expensive when they really aren't.
  Second, simple queries should complete much more quickly on this table
  compared to `main_v5`; for simple queries on a very wide table like this,
  the execution time appears to be dominated by BQ simply scanning metadata
  for all the blocks it might need to touch. Because this table contains
  only a fraction of main ping data, it is likely to have many fewer blocks to
  scan through.

  Clustering fields: `normalized_channel`, `sample_id`
