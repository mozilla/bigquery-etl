  Daily install statistics to power addons.mozilla.org stats pages.
  See bug 1654330. Note that this table uses a hashed_addon_id
  defined as `TO_HEX(SHA256(addon_id))` because the underlying event
  pings have limitations on length of properties attached to events
  and addon_id values are sometimes too long. The AMO stats application
  looks up records in this table based on the hashed_addon_id.

  The hashed_addon_id is only valid for install_stats:
