friendly_name: Stripe subscriptions history
description: |-
  History of changes to Stripe subscriptions as recorded by Fivetran, with revisions to improve historical accuracy.

  To get the historical state at a particular point in time use a condition like the following:
    valid_from <= {timestamp}
    AND valid_to > {timestamp}

  This table's schema closely mirrors Stripe's subscriptions API (https://stripe.com/docs/api/subscriptions/object).
  Fields which Fivetran doesn't sync and fields specific to Stripe Connect have been omitted.
