friendly_name: Serp Events
description: |-
  Each row in this table represents one `serp.impression` event, with information from associated `serp.ad_impression`,
  `serp.engagement`, and `serp.abandonment` events appended in the same row, indexed by `impression_id`.
  This table operates at 1 day lag, so today's job run populates the partition for 2 days ago rather than yesterday.
  Events associated with a given `impression_id` may be submitted some time after the original `impression` event,
  and this lag is intended to capture enough events associated with each impression.
  A SERP impression has either 1 or more engagements, or an abandonment reason. In either case, it has 0 or more component impressions.
