    The build identifier generated by the CI system (e.g. "1234/A"). For language bindings that provide automatic detection for this value, (e.g. Android/Kotlin), in the unlikely event that the build identifier can not be retrieved from the OS, it is set to "inaccessible". For other language bindings, if the value was not provided through configuration, this metric gets set to `Unknown`.
