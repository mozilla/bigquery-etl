  Returns canonical, human-understandable identification info for Fenix sources.

  It should be expected that the output of this function may evolve over time.
  If we rename a product or channel, we may choose to update the values here so
  that analyses consistently get the new name.

  The first argument (app_id) can be fairly fuzzy; it is tolerant of actual Google
  Play Store appId values like 'org.mozilla.firefox_beta' (mix of periods and underscores)
  as well as BigQuery dataset names with suffixes like 'org_mozilla_firefox_beta_stable'.

  The second argument (app_build_id) should be the value in client_info.app_build.
