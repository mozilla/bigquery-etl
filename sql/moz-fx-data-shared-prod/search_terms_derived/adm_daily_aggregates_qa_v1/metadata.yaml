friendly_name: Adm Daily Aggregates QA
description: |-
  This is a table that is used to alert if there are less than 100 rows produced on a given date

  Note: This table processes data from 2 days ago, matching the offset of the upstream
  adm_daily_aggregates_v1 table it validates.
  This is a temporary measure until the Merino sanitization job is further optimized.
